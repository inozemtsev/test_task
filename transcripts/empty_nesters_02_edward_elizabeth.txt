================================================================================

ADVISOR: [00:00:02] So, Edward, Elizabeth, before we get too deep into the planning side, I want to make sure I’ve got the basics right in my system. Could you both just confirm your full names for me?

CLIENT1: [00:00:11] Yeah, sure. It’s Edward James Moore.

CLIENT2: [00:00:14] And I’m Elizabeth Anne Moore.

ADVISOR: [00:00:18] Perfect, thank you. And you’re married to each other?

CLIENT2: [00:00:21] Yes, married… twenty‑seven—  

CLIENT1: [00:00:23] Twenty‑eight this summer.  

CLIENT2: [00:00:26] Right, twenty‑eight. He keeps track better than I do.  

ADVISOR: [00:00:30] Got it. And what do you like to be called day‑to‑day? Edward and Elizabeth, or something shorter?

CLIENT1: [00:00:35] Ed is fine.

CLIENT2: [00:00:36] And I’m usually Liz.

ADVISOR: [00:00:40] Great. Ed and Liz. Let me grab your dates of birth so I can line up retirement ages properly. Ed?

CLIENT1: [00:00:47] Eighteenth of March, nineteen sixty‑seven.

ADVISOR: [00:00:51] 03/18/1967. And Liz?

CLIENT2: [00:00:55] Fifth of October, nineteen sixty‑nine.

ADVISOR: [00:00:59] 10/05/1969. Thanks. How are you both doing health‑wise generally? Anything major that might affect work or retirement planning?

CLIENT1: [00:01:07] I’d say pretty good. I mean, I’ve got the standard middle‑aged things—bit of blood pressure tablets in the morning. But I still cycle on weekends.

CLIENT2: [00:01:15] Yeah, he does those silly long rides.

CLIENT1: [00:01:18] Not that long. Forty, fifty miles. Keeps me sane.

ADVISOR: [00:01:22] That’s still a decent ride. And you’re not a smoker now?

CLIENT1: [00:01:26] No, I quit in my thirties. So over twenty years ago.

ADVISOR: [00:01:30] Good. Liz, how about you?

CLIENT2: [00:01:34] I’m okay. Bit of a bad back if I sit too long, but that’s from being at a desk at the school. I walk the dog every day, we do a lot of hiking when we go down to Hocking Hills. Never smoked.

ADVISOR: [00:01:44] So generally active, nothing serious going on. That’s helpful when we’re thinking about how long you might want to work and how long the money needs to last.  

ADVISOR: [00:01:52] On the legal side, do you have wills in place at the moment?

CLIENT2: [00:01:56] We do, but they’re very old.

CLIENT1: [00:01:59] Yeah, we did something when the kids were little. Our son was, what, two? Late nineties.

CLIENT2: [00:02:04] And it still names my sister as guardian, and the kids are twenty‑four and twenty‑one now, so it feels a bit silly.

ADVISOR: [00:02:11] Right, so there is a will, but it doesn’t really reflect “empty nest and grandkids” life.

CLIENT2: [00:02:16] Exactly.

ADVISOR: [00:02:19] Okay, I’ll flag that to come back to when we talk about the house and what happens if one of you isn’t here.  

ADVISOR: [00:02:25] Before we dive into all the numbers, what would you say is the main thing you want out of working with an advisor right now?

CLIENT1: [00:02:32] For me it’s, “Are we on track to step back at, like, early sixties without having to panic?”

CLIENT2: [00:02:38] Yeah, and how the house and my pension and all of that fits together. I feel like we’ve got lots of pieces but no picture.

ADVISOR: [00:02:46] Makes sense. Let’s talk about when you’d *like* to stop full‑time. Not what you think is realistic yet, just your ideal. Ed, what age do you picture?

CLIENT1: [00:02:54] Ideal world, sixty‑two. On a bad day at work, fifty‑nine.  

CLIENT2: [00:02:59] [laughs]  

CLIENT1: [00:03:00] Realistically I’m thinking sixty‑three, sixty‑four.

ADVISOR: [00:03:03] And Liz?

CLIENT2: [00:03:06] I always thought I’d go a bit earlier than him, like sixty‑one. But with prices the way they are, I’m leaning more to sixty‑three now.

ADVISOR: [00:03:14] Do you imagine retiring at the same time, or staggering it?

CLIENT1: [00:03:18] I’d like us to go roughly together. Maybe I cut down to three days when Liz goes.

CLIENT2: [00:03:22] Yeah, I don’t see me working full‑time if he’s at home. I’d just resent him. [laughs]

ADVISOR: [00:03:27] Fair enough. When you picture that stage, say eight to ten years from now, what sort of *after‑tax* monthly income do you feel you’d want coming in to live comfortably? Not bare minimum, but not extravagant.

CLIENT2: [00:03:38] We were actually talking about this. I said if we had four thousand a month, after tax, we’d be okay.

CLIENT1: [00:03:44] And I was thinking closer to five, once you add in travel.

CLIENT2: [00:03:47] Yeah, the travel is the thing.

ADVISOR: [00:03:49] So let’s say somewhere between four and five thousand net per month as a starting point, plus a travel budget on top. We’ll refine that when we go through your spending.  

ADVISOR: [00:03:58] On that, how would you describe yourselves as investors? If I said there was a fund that might go up ten, twelve percent in a good year but could drop eight to ten percent in a bad year, how does that land?

CLIENT2: [00:04:08] I don’t like the sound of losing ten percent in a year. My stomach does a little flip.

CLIENT1: [00:04:12] I can live with some of that if it’s long term. I don’t want anything crazy, but I know it can’t just sit in cash.

ADVISOR: [00:04:18] Have you ever filled out a risk questionnaire before?

CLIENT2: [00:04:21] We did one online with our old advisor, maybe five, six years ago.

CLIENT1: [00:04:25] Yeah, we came out “steady growth” or something like that.

CLIENT2: [00:04:28] Middle of the road.

ADVISOR: [00:04:30] Has that changed now the kids are off the payroll?

CLIENT2: [00:04:34] A little. I feel like we can take a tiny bit more risk because we’re not worrying about tuition every five minutes.

CLIENT1: [00:04:40] But at the same time, we’re closer to retirement, so we don’t want to gamble with it.

ADVISOR: [00:04:44] Got it—still middle‑ground, maybe inching toward careful as you get nearer that retirement age.

CLIENT1: [00:04:49] Yeah, that sounds right.

CLIENT2: [00:04:51] Yeah.

ADVISOR: [00:04:55] Let’s bring the house into this, because it’s a big lever in your plan. Where are you living now, and do you own that place?

CLIENT1: [00:05:01] Yeah, we own. It’s a four‑bedroom in Westerville, just north of Columbus.

CLIENT2: [00:05:06] Suburbs, tree‑lined street, older neighborhood. Big yard we don’t need anymore. [laughs]

ADVISOR: [00:05:12] And ballpark, what do you think the house would sell for today?

CLIENT1: [00:05:17] I checked Zillow maybe two weeks ago? It was showing somewhere in the low fives. Like five‑ten, five‑twenty.

CLIENT2: [00:05:24] Our realtor friend said, “Figure around five hundred,” just to be conservative.

ADVISOR: [00:05:29] Okay, let’s call it around five hundred thousand. Is there still a mortgage on it?

CLIENT1: [00:05:34] Almost gone.

CLIENT2: [00:05:35] Yeah, we’re down to, what, forty? Maybe forty‑five?

CLIENT1: [00:05:39] Yeah, about forty‑ish left. Fixed rate. We’ve got just under three years if we keep paying as is.

ADVISOR: [00:05:46] Do you happen to know your monthly payment on that?

CLIENT2: [00:05:49] The standard payment is just under five hundred a month, like four‑eighty‑something. But we usually round it up.

CLIENT1: [00:05:56] Yeah, we throw a bit extra at it. So most months it’s closer to six hundred with the overpayment.

ADVISOR: [00:06:02] And which bank is that with?

CLIENT2: [00:06:04] Huntington. We refinanced with them when rates dipped.

ADVISOR: [00:06:08] Nice. And the rate’s fixed for the rest of the term?

CLIENT1: [00:06:11] Yeah, it’s a fixed, two‑point‑something. I’d have to look at the exact number.

ADVISOR: [00:06:16] Great. You mentioned when we booked this that you’re thinking about downsizing. Are you picturing selling this house at some point?

CLIENT2: [00:06:22] We go back and forth.

CLIENT1: [00:06:24] Yeah.

CLIENT2: [00:06:25] Some days I’m like, “Let’s list it next spring.” And then the grandkids come over and I’m like, “Well, the space is nice.”

CLIENT1: [00:06:31] Our rough thinking has been maybe sell in about five years. Move into something smaller—a ranch or a townhome. Still in the Columbus area.

ADVISOR: [00:06:40] So roughly around age sixty for you two, give or take.

CLIENT1: [00:06:43] Yeah, about that.

ADVISOR: [00:06:45] And would the goal be to buy the next place mortgage‑free from the sale proceeds?

CLIENT2: [00:06:50] That’s the dream. Use the equity from this to pay cash or close to it.

CLIENT1: [00:06:54] We’ve said we’d rather not have a mortgage in our seventies. If we had to have a tiny one on the next place for a few years, it wouldn’t be the end of the world, but we’d rather avoid it.

ADVISOR: [00:07:03] That makes sense. Besides the main home, do you own any other property? Rental, land, a cabin?

CLIENT1: [00:07:09] We do have the cabin.

CLIENT2: [00:07:10] Oh yeah, the lake place.

ADVISOR: [00:07:12] Tell me about that one.

CLIENT1: [00:07:15] It’s a little A‑frame cabin near Lake Logan, down in Hocking Hills. We bought into it with my brother a few years ago. So we own half, he and his wife own half.

CLIENT2: [00:07:24] It’s not huge. Two bedrooms, kind of rustic. It’s our unplug spot.

ADVISOR: [00:07:29] Roughly what’s the whole property worth, do you think?

CLIENT1: [00:07:33] Last time we looked at comps, cabins on that road were going one‑eighty to maybe two‑twenty.

CLIENT2: [00:07:38] My guess would be around two hundred.

ADVISOR: [00:07:40] And there’s no mortgage on that, right?

CLIENT1: [00:07:43] No. My brother inherited the land from my parents. We put in cash for the structure and renovations.

CLIENT2: [00:07:48] Completely paid off.

ADVISOR: [00:07:51] Do you see yourselves keeping that into retirement or is that something you might sell or rent out?

CLIENT1: [00:07:56] For now we want to keep it. It’s kind of our reset button.

CLIENT2: [00:08:00] We’ve talked about doing short‑term rentals with it, like Airbnb in the fall when we’re not down there. Just haven’t pulled the trigger.

ADVISOR: [00:08:07] Okay. That’s potentially another income source if you decide to. Ownership‑wise, it’s just the four of you on the deed? Not in an LLC?

CLIENT1: [00:08:13] Yeah, just in our names. Fifty‑fifty split.

ADVISOR: [00:08:18] Good to know. While we’re on the house, I want to understand how big a chunk your housing costs are right now. If you add up the mortgage, property taxes, insurance, utilities, internet—roughly what does that run you per month?

CLIENT2: [00:08:29] Maybe two‑and‑a‑half to three thousand? That’s with everything.

CLIENT1: [00:08:34] Yeah, I’d say closer to twenty‑eight hundred, something like that. We’re guessing though.

ADVISOR: [00:08:39] That’s fine for now. Outside of housing, what are the other “must‑pay” bills that come to mind? Groceries, cars, insurance?

CLIENT2: [00:08:47] Food is a big one. Now it’s just us it’s lower, but still… I’d say maybe eight to nine hundred a month on groceries and bits.

CLIENT1: [00:08:53] Yeah, that sounds right. We don’t track it super closely.

ADVISOR: [00:08:57] And cars—fuel, insurance, maintenance?

CLIENT1: [00:09:00] Two cars. Insurance on both is about one‑sixty a month. Gas maybe three to four hundred, depending on how much I’m driving to the office.

CLIENT2: [00:09:07] We had a big service last year, but that’s not every year. So, average, maybe a hundred a month for repairs.

ADVISOR: [00:09:13] Okay. We’ll circle back and pull this together into an overall monthly spend in a bit. I want to grab your income picture next so I can see the flow in and out.  

ADVISOR: [00:09:22] Ed, who are you working for at the moment?

CLIENT1: [00:09:25] I’m operations manager for a packaging company, Northfield Packaging, over in Dayton.

ADVISOR: [00:09:31] Full‑time, salaried?

CLIENT1: [00:09:33] Yeah, full‑time. I’ve been there sixteen years now.

ADVISOR: [00:09:37] Roughly what’s your base salary there?

CLIENT1: [00:09:40] Base is just under ninety, and with bonus some years it creeps over that.

ADVISOR: [00:09:44] Paid every two weeks?

CLIENT1: [00:09:47] Yeah, every other Friday. Twenty‑six checks a year.

ADVISOR: [00:09:50] Do you know roughly what one of those looks like before and after tax?

CLIENT1: [00:09:54] Before tax it’s a little over three thousand—three‑three, three‑four. After taxes, 401(k), health insurance, I see around two thousand, maybe two‑one, each paycheck.

CLIENT2: [00:10:04] Yeah, because when it hits our account it’s usually just over four thousand a month from him once you add the two checks.

ADVISOR: [00:10:10] Any regular bonus, or is that more ad hoc?

CLIENT1: [00:10:13] It’s not guaranteed. Some years we get a profit‑share. Last year it was maybe four thousand. Year before there was nothing.

ADVISOR: [00:10:20] And you mentioned a small pension from a previous employer when we chatted by email. Can you remind me what that is?

CLIENT1: [00:10:26] Yeah, from a manufacturing company I worked for in my thirties, Metro Components. Old‑school pension. It’s frozen now. The letter said if I leave it till sixty‑five it should pay around four hundred a month.

ADVISOR: [00:10:36] Okay, so a small defined‑benefit pension on top of everything else. Nice “coffee money,” as some clients call it.

CLIENT2: [00:10:42] Yeah, that’s what we joke.

ADVISOR: [00:10:45] Liz, how about you—where are you working?

CLIENT2: [00:10:48] I’m a school counselor at Maple Grove High School. It’s the public high school near where we live.

ADVISOR: [00:10:53] Full‑time during the school year?

CLIENT2: [00:10:56] Technically full‑time, but I get the school holidays, so it doesn’t feel as intense.

ADVISOR: [00:11:00] And your salary there?

CLIENT2: [00:11:02] Around forty‑two a year, give or take. Depends on extra duties.

ADVISOR: [00:11:06] Paid twice a month?

CLIENT2: [00:11:08] Yeah, the fifteenth and the last day.

ADVISOR: [00:11:11] What usually hits the bank each time?

CLIENT2: [00:11:14] Net it’s around fifteen hundred each paycheck after taxes and my share of health insurance.

ADVISOR: [00:11:20] Good. Any regular bonuses?

CLIENT2: [00:11:22] We usually get a small year‑end stipend, maybe five or six hundred dollars. Some years they skip it.

ADVISOR: [00:11:28] Beyond those jobs, any other income sources? Rental income, side businesses?

CLIENT1: [00:11:33] I do a little consulting for a buddy who runs a smaller plant. Just when he’s got a big project. Maybe a couple of weekends a year.

ADVISOR: [00:11:39] Roughly what does that bring in?

CLIENT1: [00:11:42] Three thousand on a busy year? Some years nothing. We just report it as self‑employment income.

CLIENT2: [00:11:48] It usually turns into vacation money.

ADVISOR: [00:11:52] Any meaningful interest or dividends outside your retirement accounts?

CLIENT2: [00:11:56] Our savings account throws off maybe a couple hundred a year.

CLIENT1: [00:11:59] Yeah, the 1099 last year was two‑hundred‑something. Nothing huge.

ADVISOR: [00:12:04] Okay. How secure do you both feel in those jobs? Any concerns about layoffs or big changes in pay?

CLIENT1: [00:12:10] Northfield’s been pretty stable. Packaging’s not glamorous, but people always need boxes. [laughs] We’ve had some ups and downs, but I’m not expecting layoffs.

CLIENT2: [00:12:19] The school feels steady unless they really slash budgets. Counseling’s pretty needed right now.

ADVISOR: [00:12:25] You mentioned earlier, Liz, that you’ve thought about cutting back hours once the mortgage is gone. Where’s your head on that today?

CLIENT2: [00:12:32] I’d like to drop to three days a week once the house is paid off. Some days I think, “I’ll just stay as I am till sixty‑five,” and other days I’m on Zillow looking at condos. [laughs]

CLIENT1: [00:12:42] Yeah, it depends how her week’s gone.

ADVISOR: [00:12:45] If you dropped to three days, do you have a sense of what that would do to your pay?

CLIENT2: [00:12:49] My principal said it would just pro‑rate. So instead of low forties it’d be low thirties, something like that.

ADVISOR: [00:12:56] Alright. We’ll model both paths: stay full‑time versus cutting back when the mortgage is gone.  

ADVISOR: [00:13:01] Before we get into your retirement accounts, I want to finish the picture on day‑to‑day living. If you add everything up in your head—the housing we talked about, food, cars, insurance, plus a typical month of going out and small trips—what do you think you’re spending a month on average?

CLIENT1: [00:13:14] Uh… maybe five to six thousand? Somewhere in there.

CLIENT2: [00:13:18] I was going to say closer to six. Once you add in meals out and weekends away, it creeps up.

ADVISOR: [00:13:24] And travel in particular—what does a typical year look like right now?

CLIENT2: [00:13:28] We usually do one bigger vacation. Last year was Italy for ten days. Then we’ll do a couple of long weekends. Visit our daughter in Denver once or twice.

CLIENT1: [00:13:37] Some years it’s more, some less. We don’t have a fixed “travel budget.” If there’s extra in the account, we book something.

ADVISOR: [00:13:43] In retirement, do you picture doing *more* of that, at least in the first ten years?

CLIENT2: [00:13:47] Definitely. That’s kind of the dream—have a set amount just for travel.

CLIENT1: [00:13:51] Front‑load it while the knees still work. [laughs]

ADVISOR: [00:13:55] And you’d class travel as “nice to have,” not absolute essential?

CLIENT2: [00:13:59] Discretionary, yeah. I’d be miserable without any trips, but we could scale it back if we had to.

CLIENT1: [00:14:04] That’s our fun money.

ADVISOR: [00:14:08] You mentioned kids and a grandchild. Any ongoing support there?

CLIENT1: [00:14:12] Our son and his wife have a little girl. We help with her daycare.

CLIENT2: [00:14:16] Yeah, we send them two to three hundred dollars a month towards nursery.

ADVISOR: [00:14:20] And that’s an informal arrangement?

CLIENT2: [00:14:23] Yeah. We said we’d do it until she’s in school full‑time. So probably another three years. She just turned two.

ADVISOR: [00:14:29] Would you treat that as essential in the short term?

CLIENT2: [00:14:32] Emotionally, yes. We promised them.

CLIENT1: [00:14:35] Realistically, if something happened—health, job—we *could* cut back. But we’d rather not.

ADVISOR: [00:14:40] Okay, I’ll jot that down as a high‑priority family support expense for roughly three more years.  

ADVISOR: [00:14:47] Any other regular commitments we haven’t touched? Church tithes, subscriptions, things that add up?

CLIENT1: [00:14:52] Gym memberships. That’s, what, sixty bucks a month total?

CLIENT2: [00:14:56] And Netflix, Spotify, all the usual. Nothing huge.

ADVISOR: [00:15:00] Alright. This gives me a good feel: you’re spending mid‑five‑thousands a month, roughly half core bills and half more flexible spending like travel, eating out, helping the kids.  

ADVISOR: [00:15:09] Let’s pivot to what you’ve built up. Ed, Liz, I’d like to spend a few minutes on what you *own*—house, other property we’ve started on, savings, retirement accounts. Does that sound alright?

CLIENT1: [00:15:18] Yeah, that’s fine.

CLIENT2: [00:15:19] Sure.

ADVISOR: [00:15:22] We’ve covered the house and the cabin. So let’s shift to more liquid stuff. Cash accounts first—checking, savings, that sort of thing. What do you usually keep in the bank?

CLIENT2: [00:15:30] Our checking kind of bounces around. We usually have five to eight thousand sitting there, depending on the week.

CLIENT1: [00:15:35] Yeah, paycheck timing and all that.

CLIENT2: [00:15:38] Then we’ve got a savings account at the credit union—it’s a higher‑yield one. That’s around forty thousand right now? Maybe a little under.

CLIENT1: [00:15:45] Mid‑thirties to forty, yeah. Part of that is my mom’s inheritance that we just parked there because we didn’t know what to do yet.

ADVISOR: [00:15:52] Roughly how much of that is inheritance money?

CLIENT2: [00:15:55] Maybe twenty? Twenty‑something?

CLIENT1: [00:15:58] She left us low twenties, like twenty‑two, twenty‑three thousand when everything settled. Most of that’s still sitting in cash.

ADVISOR: [00:16:05] Any CDs or other bank products on top of that?

CLIENT2: [00:16:08] We do have a CD. Twelve‑month, started it in April.

CLIENT1: [00:16:12] At Huntington.

CLIENT2: [00:16:13] Right, Huntington. It’s just under twenty thousand. That matures next April—twenty‑twenty‑six.

ADVISOR: [00:16:20] So in April 2026 that CD will come due and you’ll decide whether to roll it or use it.

CLIENT2: [00:16:24] Exactly.

ADVISOR: [00:16:27] With the inheritance piece, do you have any early thoughts? For example, using some for Roth IRA contributions, putting it towards the mortgage, or keeping it for a future downsize or kitchen update?

CLIENT1: [00:16:36] Yeah, we’ve talked about Roth.

CLIENT2: [00:16:38] We keep saying, “We should do Roths,” and then… life.

CLIENT1: [00:16:41] My idea was maybe drip it in over a few years. Use part for Roth contributions for both of us, and then hold some back in case we do a kitchen update if we decide not to move right away.

ADVISOR: [00:16:50] Okay. We’ll run some numbers on the trade‑offs—Roth versus mortgage versus house projects.  

ADVISOR: [00:16:56] Outside of the bank, any taxable investment accounts? Brokerage, company stock?

CLIENT1: [00:17:00] I’ve got a little brokerage at Fidelity. Started with company stock, but I sold most of that. It’s, I don’t know, twenty to thirty thousand now. Mostly an S&P fund.

CLIENT2: [00:17:08] That’s more his toy. I just peek at it when the market’s doing something crazy.

ADVISOR: [00:17:13] And you mentioned an HSA earlier—how much is in there roughly?

CLIENT1: [00:17:17] About ten or eleven thousand. We’ve been trying not to touch it. Just pay minor stuff out of pocket.

ADVISOR: [00:17:22] Good. HSAs can be a really tax‑efficient bucket for retirement medical costs.  

ADVISOR: [00:17:27] Let’s move to retirement accounts since those are a big piece for you. Ed, what do you have through Northfield?

CLIENT1: [00:17:33] I’ve got a 401(k). Balance last time I looked was in the high two hundreds—maybe two‑ninety, three hundred.

ADVISOR: [00:17:39] And how is that invested?

CLIENT1: [00:17:42] It’s in one of those target‑date funds. Twenty‑thirty‑five, I think. So kind of middle of the road.

ADVISOR: [00:17:48] How much are you contributing from your paycheck?

CLIENT1: [00:17:51] I’m doing eight percent. The company matches four.

ADVISOR: [00:17:55] Great. And you also mentioned an IRA?

CLIENT1: [00:17:59] Yeah, I rolled an old 401(k) into an IRA at Vanguard a while back. That one’s, I think, around ninety thousand. Mostly index funds—maybe seventy percent stock, thirty bonds? I’d need to double‑check.

ADVISOR: [00:18:10] Any other pensions besides the Metro Components one we mentioned?

CLIENT1: [00:18:13] No, that’s it. The Metro one and whatever Social Security ends up being.

ADVISOR: [00:18:19] Have you looked at your Social Security statement recently?

CLIENT1: [00:18:22] Yeah, about six months ago. It said if I wait to my full retirement age—sixty‑seven—it’d be around twenty‑three hundred a month. If I take it at sixty‑two, it drops to about sixteen hundred.

ADVISOR: [00:18:32] Okay, that’s helpful. Liz, let’s talk through your retirement side. You’re in the state teachers’ retirement system through the district, right?

CLIENT2: [00:18:39] Yeah, that’s a pension. STRS. I don’t know the exact numbers. They send those statements and I skim them.

CLIENT1: [00:18:45] We looked once and it was like, “You’ll get something.” [laughs]

CLIENT2: [00:18:48] I remember if I retire around sixty‑two, it was showing maybe two thousand, twenty‑five hundred a month? Roughly.

ADVISOR: [00:18:55] That gives us a ballpark. And do you also have a 403(b) through the district?

CLIENT2: [00:19:00] I have a 403(b) with TIAA. That’s around, I want to say, one‑fifty? It was one‑forty‑something last time I logged in.

ADVISOR: [00:19:07] Are you contributing regularly?

CLIENT2: [00:19:10] Yes. I do eight percent of my pay. The district matches four, I think. We bumped it up when the kids were done with college.

ADVISOR: [00:19:18] Any other retirement accounts—old IRAs from previous jobs?

CLIENT2: [00:19:22] I have a small traditional IRA at Schwab from when my dad passed. We moved some inheritance there. It’s maybe twenty, twenty‑five thousand. We haven’t added much since.

ADVISOR: [00:19:32] And your Social Security statement—do you remember your estimate?

CLIENT2: [00:19:36] Mine was lower than Ed’s because I stayed home with the kids for a while. At full retirement age it showed about eighteen hundred a month. If I took it early it was closer to twelve, thirteen hundred.

ADVISOR: [00:19:47] Alright. Between the teacher pension, your 403(b), your IRAs, Ed’s 401(k), IRA, and that small Metro pension plus Social Security, there are several future income streams we can coordinate.  

ADVISOR: [00:19:57] Zooming out, has anyone ever laid out your overall mix—how much of your investments are in stocks versus bonds and cash across all these accounts?

CLIENT1: [00:20:04] Our old advisor did a pie chart once. I want to say we were like sixty, sixty‑five percent in stocks overall. That was before the pandemic.

CLIENT2: [00:20:11] Yeah, I remember a screen with lots of colored slices. I mostly just asked, “Are we on track?” and he said yes. But that was before we really started thinking about retiring earlier and moving.

ADVISOR: [00:20:20] Understood. We’ll recreate that big picture once I’ve got your statements.  

ADVISOR: [00:20:24] Let me loop back for a second to the mortgage, because it connects to your risk level and retirement timing. You said you’ve got about forty thousand left and three years to go if you keep paying as is. Have you ever missed a payment or been late?

CLIENT1: [00:20:34] No, never properly missed. We had one late one years ago when they changed the draft date, but it was only a few days and they said it was fine.

ADVISOR: [00:20:40] And your comfort level with the roughly six hundred a month you’re sending to Huntington, plus the car loan—how does that feel?

CLIENT1: [00:20:46] It’s fine at the moment. Since the kids left, we’ve had more wiggle room. Some of what used to go on tuition and groceries is now going into my 401(k) and the extra mortgage payments.

CLIENT2: [00:20:53] Yeah, if anything changed, we’d drop the overpayments before we touched the pension contributions.

ADVISOR: [00:20:59] That’s useful to know—pensions first, then mortgage prepayments. Do you know if Huntington lets you pay extra without penalties?

CLIENT1: [00:21:05] I think they allow up to ten percent of the balance a year without a fee. We’re nowhere near that.

ADVISOR: [00:21:10] Good. Any other debt besides the mortgage?

CLIENT2: [00:21:13] There’s my car. Honda loan, about two hundred a month. I think there’s a year left.

CLIENT1: [00:21:18] My Subaru is paid off.

CLIENT2: [00:21:20] And then just the credit card, but we clear that every month.

ADVISOR: [00:21:24] Okay, so outside the mortgage you’ve got roughly two hundred a month on the car for one more year, and no revolving balances. Pretty clean.  

ADVISOR: [00:21:31] Do you have any life insurance that was set up specifically for the mortgage or for income replacement?

CLIENT2: [00:21:36] We’ve got an old decreasing term policy. Took it out when the mortgage was a lot bigger. I think the cover’s still around a hundred thousand, even though the mortgage is forty now. It ends about the same time as the mortgage term.

CLIENT1: [00:21:47] We keep saying we should check whether it’s still the right thing or if we’re over‑insured, but we haven’t got round to it.

ADVISOR: [00:21:53] Any coverage through work?

CLIENT1: [00:21:55] Yeah, I’ve got a group life policy—two times my salary, I think.

CLIENT2: [00:21:59] I have one year’s salary through the school.

ADVISOR: [00:22:03] Disability coverage?

CLIENT1: [00:22:05] Short‑term and long‑term through work, yes.

CLIENT2: [00:22:07] Same here, though I couldn’t tell you the exact percentages.

ADVISOR: [00:22:11] That’s fine. We’ll pull those details later. Given your goal to protect each other and also the kids, are you trying to leave a big inheritance, or is the main objective more “we want to be secure and if there’s something left, great”?

CLIENT2: [00:22:22] More the second one. I mean, I’d like to leave *something*, but I don’t want to live on beans just so the kids get a big lump sum.

CLIENT1: [00:22:29] Yeah, we don’t want to be a burden. If there’s the house and some accounts left, great. But we’re not aiming to die with ten million.

ADVISOR: [00:22:36] How about helping with grandkids—college funds, that sort of thing?

CLIENT2: [00:22:40] We’ve talked about 529s. We put a little bit in one for our granddaughter, like a couple hundred to open it, but haven’t made it regular.

CLIENT1: [00:22:47] We wanted to get through our own mortgage first. Then maybe bump that up.

ADVISOR: [00:22:52] That’s a common order of priorities. We’ll look at how much room there is once we plug in your retirement savings and see what’s realistic for college gifts.  

ADVISOR: [00:23:00] Let me check something on the retirement timing, because it ties back to your health comments. If, say, your blood pressure worsened, Ed, or your back got worse, Liz, and you couldn’t carry on full‑time to sixty‑three, how important is it to have the option to scale back earlier even if it means a bit less income later?

CLIENT1: [00:23:12] That’s pretty important. My dad had to leave at sixty because of his heart and money was tight. I don’t want us stuck like that.

CLIENT2: [00:23:18] I’d rather have the flexibility, yes. Maybe that means we accept more like four thousand a month instead of five when the time comes.

ADVISOR: [00:23:25] So security and options are as important as squeezing out every last dollar of return.

CLIENT1: [00:23:29] Yeah, we’d rather sleep at night.

CLIENT2: [00:23:31] Exactly.

ADVISOR: [00:23:35] On that note, with your investments—if we had a year like 2022 again where markets dropped and your accounts went down, say, ten percent on paper, what would you *do*? Panic and sell, or ride it out?

CLIENT1: [00:23:44] I try not to look too often. I didn’t sell in 2020. It wasn’t fun, but I just left it.

CLIENT2: [00:23:49] I mostly avoid logging in when the news is bad. [laughs] I don’t think we’d sell everything, but I’d be nervous.

ADVISOR: [00:23:55] Okay, that helps me calibrate. Moderate risk tolerance with some hand‑holding in bad years.  

ADVISOR: [00:24:01] Let’s touch briefly on how these accounts could feed your retirement. In your heads, which accounts do you see yourselves tapping first—401(k)/403(b), IRAs, home equity, or the cabin?

CLIENT1: [00:24:11] I always pictured: we downsize, use some of the house equity to make the smaller place nice—maybe that kitchen we keep talking about—and then live mainly off pensions and Social Security and the 401(k)/403(b).

CLIENT2: [00:24:21] I’ve wondered about using my little Schwab IRA or some of his Vanguard IRA for the move, instead of touching the bigger 403(b)/401(k). I don’t really know what’s smartest tax‑wise.

ADVISOR: [00:24:30] That’s exactly the sort of thing we’ll model. There are pros and cons to using pre‑tax money for a house versus keeping it as an income source.  

ADVISOR: [00:24:37] Let me circle back to something you mentioned early on: wills. Apart from the outdated wills, do you have powers of attorney or healthcare directives in place?

CLIENT2: [00:24:44] I think they did a basic healthcare thing when we did the wills, but I honestly don’t remember what it says.

CLIENT1: [00:24:49] I remember signing a lot of paper. That’s about it.

ADVISOR: [00:24:53] Okay, so likely something is in place but probably worth updating along with the wills, especially now you’ve got a cabin co‑owned with your brother and an adult daughter out of state. I can introduce you to an estate attorney if you’d like later on.

CLIENT2: [00:25:03] That would be helpful. It’s one of those things we keep putting off.

ADVISOR: [00:25:08] Totally normal.  

ADVISOR: [00:25:11] I want to make sure I haven’t missed any assets. We’ve got: the Westerville home, the Lake Logan cabin, checking and savings at the credit union, a CD at Huntington, Ed’s Fidelity brokerage, the HSA, Ed’s 401(k) and Vanguard IRA, Liz’s TIAA 403(b) and Schwab IRA, plus your pensions and future Social Security. Any other big‑ticket items? Boats, RVs, collections?

CLIENT1: [00:25:29] No boat. [laughs]

CLIENT2: [00:25:31] No RV. Just the two cars, and they’re, you know, normal cars.

ADVISOR: [00:25:35] Great. After the call, could you email me recent statements or screenshots for the 401(k), IRA, 403(b), HSA, brokerage, and the CD? That way I can plug in exact balances.

CLIENT1: [00:25:43] Yeah, I can pull those tonight.

CLIENT2: [00:25:45] I’ll try to dig up the pension statement too. It’s either in a drawer or online somewhere.

ADVISOR: [00:25:51] Perfect.  

ADVISOR: [00:25:54] I want to go back for a moment to what you said about downsizing around sixty. When you picture that next place, what do you imagine? Condo, smaller single‑family, staying in Westerville versus moving closer to the kids?

CLIENT2: [00:26:04] I’d like a ranch, less yard. Still in the Columbus area. I don’t really want to move states.

CLIENT1: [00:26:09] Yeah, I want to be close enough to see the granddaughter regularly. Maybe something walkable—less driving.

ADVISOR: [00:26:15] Any thoughts about could the cabin ever become your main place, or is that firmly a getaway?

CLIENT1: [00:26:19] Firmly getaway. It’s great for weekends, but I don’t want to be that far from doctors and grocery stores full‑time.

CLIENT2: [00:26:25] And internet’s terrible down there. [laughs]

ADVISOR: [00:26:28] Fair point.  

ADVISOR: [00:26:31] As we pull all this together, a big question clients in your position often have is, “Should we be putting extra toward the mortgage or squeezing every bit into retirement accounts?” How have you been thinking about that trade‑off?

CLIENT1: [00:26:41] We’ve sort of split the difference. Upped our 401(k)/403(b) when the kids were out of the house, and then rounded the mortgage payment up a bit.

CLIENT2: [00:26:47] I like seeing the balance go down faster, but I also know the retirement stuff is important.

ADVISOR: [00:26:52] Okay. Given your low interest rate and the fact you’re three years from payoff anyway, I suspect keeping retirement contributions strong will make sense, but we’ll run the numbers.

CLIENT1: [00:27:00] Yeah, I kind of figured the math might lean that way.

ADVISOR: [00:27:04] One more angle on income in retirement: do either of you see yourselves doing any part‑time work or consulting once you “retire,” or is the goal a clean break?

CLIENT1: [00:27:12] I could see doing a bit of consulting, like I am now, just more structured. Maybe a day or two a week for a few years.

CLIENT2: [00:27:17] I could see subbing or doing some private counseling part‑time, but I don’t want to rely on it.

ADVISOR: [00:27:23] So, nice‑to‑have income, but not something you want to *need* to cover the basics.

CLIENT1: [00:27:27] Right.

CLIENT2: [00:27:28] Exactly.

ADVISOR: [00:27:32] In terms of taxes, you’re both earning W‑2 income at the moment, mid‑teen federal bracket plus state, and almost all of your retirement accounts are pre‑tax—401(k), 403(b), traditional IRAs. You’ve mentioned Roths a couple of times. What have you heard about Roths that appeals to you?

CLIENT2: [00:27:45] The idea of tax‑free later. My colleague at school keeps saying, “You’ll wish you had Roths in retirement.”

CLIENT1: [00:27:51] And that you can pass them on to the kids and it’s better for them too.

ADVISOR: [00:27:55] Exactly. And they can also help manage your tax brackets once you’re taking Social Security and pensions. We’ll explore whether contributions now or maybe Roth *conversions* later make sense for you.

CLIENT1: [00:28:04] Conversions is where you move some of the 401(k) into a Roth and pay the tax now, right?

ADVISOR: [00:28:08] That’s right. You’d deliberately shift, say, ten or twenty thousand from pre‑tax to Roth in a given year, pay the tax that year, and then it grows tax‑free from then on. It’s often attractive in lower‑income years, like if one of you cuts back hours before Social Security kicks in.

CLIENT2: [00:28:20] Okay. So if I went to three days a week, that might be a window?

ADVISOR: [00:28:24] Potentially, yes. We’d want to be careful about not pushing you into a higher bracket or messing with Medicare premiums later, but that’s the kind of strategy we’ll look at.  

ADVISOR: [00:28:31] Let me just check: apart from the cabin, do you expect any other inheritances or big windfalls—your parents, siblings?

CLIENT2: [00:28:37] My mom was the big one, and we already got that.

CLIENT1: [00:28:40] My folks don’t have much beyond their house, and that’ll likely go to help my brother, to be honest.

ADVISOR: [00:28:45] So we’re not planning on a future big inheritance. That’s actually easier—less moving parts.  

ADVISOR: [00:28:49] Any big expenses on the horizon we should keep in mind: weddings, major home renovations, buying an RV?

CLIENT2: [00:28:54] [laughs] No RV. Maybe a kitchen if we decide to stay put longer.

CLIENT1: [00:28:58] And maybe a new roof, but hopefully not both in the same year.

ADVISOR: [00:29:02] Okay, so we’ll assume a possible chunk for house projects in the next five years. That could come from some combination of cash, that CD, or maybe a small piece of a retirement account if that’s efficient.  

ADVISOR: [00:29:10] I know we’ve covered a lot of ground. Before we start pulling it together into “what‑ifs” around retirement dates and income, is there anything about money that keeps you up at night that we haven’t touched on?

CLIENT2: [00:29:19] For me it’s healthcare. Like, what if one of us needs a lot of care later?

CLIENT1: [00:29:23] Yeah, nursing home stuff. I don’t want to blow through everything and have nothing left for Liz if something happens to me.

ADVISOR: [00:29:29] That’s a big one. We’ll look at your projected cash flows and see whether self‑funding looks realistic or whether some kind of long‑term care insurance or hybrid policy fits. It’s not a decision for today, but it’s good to get it on the list.

CLIENT2: [00:29:39] Okay.

ADVISOR: [00:29:42] Shorter‑term, when you think about the next, say, three years—before the mortgage is gone—do you feel pretty comfortable with your monthly surplus? Or is it tight?

CLIENT1: [00:29:49] It’s comfortable. We’re not rolling in it, but we’re not watching every penny.

CLIENT2: [00:29:53] Yeah, there’s usually a few hundred left at the end of the month, more if Ed gets a bonus.

ADVISOR: [00:29:59] Good. That gives us some room to tweak things without causing pain.  

ADVISOR: [00:30:03] So, next steps on my side: I’ll plug everything you’ve told me—income, spending, assets, pensions—into our planning software. Once I’ve got your statements and your Social Security estimates, I’ll build a few scenarios: for example, both retire at sixty‑three, or Liz goes to three days when the mortgage is paid, or you downsize at sixty and retire a couple of years later.

CLIENT2: [00:30:21] Okay.

CLIENT1: [00:30:22] Sounds good.

ADVISOR: [00:30:25] Between now and then, if you happen to find the STRS pension statement and the Metro Components letter, just send them along. The more precise those numbers are, the better the projections will be.  

CLIENT2: [00:30:33] I’ll put “find pension stuff” on my weekend list.

CLIENT1: [00:30:36] And I’ll pull the 401(k) and IRA ones.

ADVISOR: [00:30:39] Perfect.  

ADVISOR: [00:30:42] Before we wrap up, is there anything else you were hoping we’d talk about today that we haven’t touched?

CLIENT2: [00:30:47] I *was* going to ask, but it might be more of a next‑time thing—just how realistic it is for me to go to three days a week in, like, three years.

ADVISOR: [00:30:54] It’s a good question. Off the top of my head, given what you’ve built up and the fact you’ll be close to paying off the mortgage, it feels possible, but I don’t want to wing it. Let me run the numbers with your exact balances and we’ll see what the trade‑offs are—maybe it means slightly lower travel budget or starting Social Security a bit later to compensate.

CLIENT2: [00:31:08] Okay, that makes sense.

CLIENT1: [00:31:10] And I’d like to see what it looks like if I went at sixty‑two instead of sixty‑four. Just to see the hit.

ADVISOR: [00:31:15] We can definitely show that—how much monthly income you’d get in each case and how much safety margin you have.  

ADVISOR: [00:31:20] Any other questions on your mind right now?

CLIENT1: [00:31:23] Nothing else jumping out.

CLIENT2: [00:31:25] I think my brain’s full. [laughs]

ADVISOR: [00:31:28] That’s totally normal after a fact‑find. Once I’ve built those scenarios, we’ll set up another meeting and go through them together. In the meantime, feel free to email if you stumble on a question or find a statement and aren’t sure if it’s relevant.

CLIENT1: [00:31:38] Will do.

CLIENT2: [00:31:40] Thanks. This was helpful to talk through.

ADVISOR: [00:31:43] You’re welcome. I appreciate you sharing all the details—it really does make a difference.
