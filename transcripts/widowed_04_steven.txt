================================================================================

ADVISOR: [00:00:05] Okay, Steven, before we dig into the pensions and the inheritance, I just need to check a few basics so I’ve got everything right in the system. Could you confirm your full name for me?

CLIENT: [00:00:14] Sure. It’s Steven Luis Martinez. Most people just call me Steve, though.

ADVISOR: [00:00:22] Perfect. I’ll stick with Steve if that’s alright. And your last name—Martinez—is that M‑A‑R‑T‑I‑N‑E‑Z?

CLIENT: [00:00:32] Yeah, that’s it. People always wanna throw an S on the end, but there’s no S.

ADVISOR: [00:00:38] Got it, no S. And your date of birth?

CLIENT: [00:00:44] Fourteenth of April, nineteen fifty‑four. I turned seventy‑one back in April.

ADVISOR: [00:00:52] Seventy‑one, okay. And your current relationship status—are you single, partnered, widowed?

CLIENT: [00:01:00] Widowed. My wife, Maria, passed about seven years ago now. I’ve been on my own in the house since then.

ADVISOR: [00:01:09] I’m sorry, Steve. Do you live completely on your own, or does anyone stay with you regularly?

CLIENT: [00:01:16] Yeah, just me. My son’s about twenty minutes away, on the east side. My daughter’s up in Fort Collins, so she’s more of a weekend or holidays visitor. Day to day it’s just me rattling around.

ADVISOR: [00:01:29] Understood. How are you finding things health‑wise at the moment? I don’t need anything too personal—just a general picture so I know what sort of time frame we’re planning for.

CLIENT: [00:01:38] For my age, I’m pretty okay. Bit of arthritis in the knees, I’m on tablets for blood pressure. But I still walk in the park most mornings. No big surgeries or anything—touch wood.

ADVISOR: [00:01:51] And smoking history—do you smoke now, or did you in the past?

CLIENT: [00:01:57] I used to. Gave it up… must be close to twenty years ago. Haven’t touched one since. My doctor’s happy enough with me, just says “keep moving.”

ADVISOR: [00:02:07] Good for you for quitting. Looking ahead, how long do you picture yourself staying in your own home, doing those walks—are you thinking “as long as possible,” or do you have an age in mind where you might want more support?

CLIENT: [00:02:18] I’d like to stay put at least into my mid‑eighties if I can. After that, if the stairs start to win, I’d look at some kind of assisted place or maybe move closer to my daughter. But I don’t want to rush into that. I want my money to be steady for twenty years or more.

ADVISOR: [00:02:34] That gives us a nice long planning window. In the nearer term—say over the next one to three years—what are the main things you’d like your money to do for you?

CLIENT: [00:02:44] This year I wanna get my will and all that legal stuff sorted properly. Power of attorney, those forms. And in about three years my eldest granddaughter starts college; I’d like to help with her fees, and maybe a bit for the younger ones when it’s their turn.

ADVISOR: [00:02:58] Okay, estate planning and education help. We’ll build those in as priorities. Before we get into the money in detail, could you tell me a bit about what you did before you retired? What was your last job?

CLIENT: [00:03:09] I was a senior project engineer with the City of Albuquerque, in the transport department. Roads, traffic lights, that kinda thing. I’d been with the city a little over twenty years by the time I left.

ADVISOR: [00:03:22] And when did you stop working there?

CLIENT: [00:03:27] End of twenty‑seventeen. I was sixty‑three. I’d always had sixty‑six, sixty‑seven in my head as the retirement age, but Maria got sick and I wanted more time at home with her.

ADVISOR: [00:03:40] Right, so you retired a bit earlier than planned. Had you had other employers before the city?

CLIENT: [00:03:45] Yeah, I did about ten years at Rocky Mountain Manufacturing in my thirties. And before that, a stint at Public Service Company of New Mexico, the utility. That one was union—Southwest Electrical Workers. So everything’s a bit scattered.

ADVISOR: [00:03:58] That explains the different pensions you mentioned when we first spoke. When you were working full‑time, do you remember roughly what tax bracket you were in? It helps me understand the highest level of tax you’ve seen.

CLIENT: [00:04:07] My accountant always said I was in the mid federal bracket. One year he mentioned twenty‑four percent. Never the top one. Now he reckons I’m down lower, since it’s just pensions and interest.

ADVISOR: [00:04:18] That’s helpful. And just to be clear, you’re fully retired now—no part‑time work or consulting?

CLIENT: [00:04:24] No, no paid work. I get asked to look at the odd project, but I haven’t taken anything on. The knees complain if I’m up ladders too much.

ADVISOR: [00:04:34] Fair enough. Is your mobile number still the one ending in four‑seven‑three‑nine?

CLIENT: [00:04:38] Yeah, that’s the one. I keep that on me all the time.

ADVISOR: [00:04:45] Great. What I’d like to do is get a picture of three things today: what’s coming in, what you own, and roughly what you spend. That lets us see if your goals—like helping the grandkids and updating the will—fit comfortably. Does that sound okay?

CLIENT: [00:04:58] Yeah, that’s what I was hoping for, really.


ADVISOR: [00:05:12] Let’s start with where you live. Do you own your home or are you renting at the moment?

CLIENT: [00:05:18] I own it. It’s a little ranch house on the west side of Albuquerque.

ADVISOR: [00:05:25] And is there still a mortgage on that, or is it paid off?

CLIENT: [00:05:30] No, that’s paid off. We finished it… I wanna say ten, maybe twelve years ago. No loan on it now.

ADVISOR: [00:05:40] So mortgage‑free primary home. Rough idea what it might be worth if you put it on the market today?

CLIENT: [00:05:46] I look at Zillow sometimes. It says low four hundreds. Four‑twenty, four‑thirty, somewhere in there. I don’t know how accurate that is.

ADVISOR: [00:05:57] That’s good enough for planning. Three‑bed, two‑bath, right?

CLIENT: [00:06:02] Yeah, three bedrooms, two bath. Just me in there now, but the kids still call it “the house,” like it’s a person.

ADVISOR: [00:06:10] Is it just in your name now?

CLIENT: [00:06:13] Just me. When Maria passed, the attorney had me sign some paperwork to take her off the title.

ADVISOR: [00:06:21] Any home equity line, second mortgage, anything like that?

CLIENT: [00:06:24] No, nothing. Just property taxes and insurance.

ADVISOR: [00:06:30] Do you have a sense of what you pay in property tax each year?

CLIENT: [00:06:35] Last bill… I think it was around thirty‑five hundred, maybe a little more. It’s crept up.

ADVISOR: [00:06:44] And homeowners insurance?

CLIENT: [00:06:47] Seven, eight hundred a year, somewhere in there.

ADVISOR: [00:06:52] With your pensions and Social Security coming in, are you comfortable covering those taxes and upkeep on the house?

CLIENT: [00:06:58] Yeah, between my pension, Social Security, and the little survivor pensions, that’s more than enough. I’m not dipping into savings for the house bills.

ADVISOR: [00:07:09] That’s good. Do you see yourself staying in that house long‑term, or is there any thought of selling or downsizing in, say, the next five to ten years?

CLIENT: [00:07:19] That’s the big question. My daughter keeps telling me to move closer to her in Fort Collins. I like my neighbors, though. If I did move, it’d probably be in a few years, not right away.

ADVISOR: [00:07:30] Okay, so possible downsize or relocation later, but nothing immediate. Aside from your primary home, do you own any other property—vacation place, land, rental?

CLIENT: [00:07:40] Yeah, there’s a cabin.

ADVISOR: [00:07:43] A cabin?

CLIENT: [00:07:45] Yeah, my brother, my sister, and I have a little cabin up by Pagosa Springs in Colorado. It was my parents’.

ADVISOR: [00:07:53] Nice area. Is that in all three of your names?

CLIENT: [00:07:57] Yes, third each. We never changed that after my dad passed.

ADVISOR: [00:08:02] Any mortgage on the cabin?

CLIENT: [00:08:05] No, that’s free and clear. Taxes are low up there. We just split them three ways.

ADVISOR: [00:08:11] Any idea what the whole cabin would sell for if you listed it?

CLIENT: [00:08:16] Uh… my brother guesses maybe two‑fifty, two‑eighty. It’s not fancy. No lake, just trees.

ADVISOR: [00:08:23] So mid‑two hundreds for the whole place, and your share is a third. Do you ever rent it out?

CLIENT: [00:08:29] Just family. The kids use it in the summer. No rental income.

ADVISOR: [00:08:34] And between the house and the cabin, any thoughts on what you want to happen with those when you’re gone? Keep them in the family, or are you fine if the kids sell?

CLIENT: [00:08:44] The kids say they’d probably sell the house. My son might hang onto the cabin for hunting, but he’s not big on being a landlord or anything. Mostly they say, “Don’t make it complicated, Dad.”

ADVISOR: [00:08:56] That’s useful to know for the estate planning piece.


ADVISOR: [00:09:09] Let’s switch gears and talk about what’s coming in each month. You said you’re fully retired, no paid work. What are your main income sources now?

CLIENT: [00:09:17] Well, the big ones are Social Security and my union pension from when I worked at the utility. Then I’ve got a survivor pension from Maria’s teaching, and a smaller annuity from her TIAA thing. Plus the little one from the lab I did a few years at. Feels like a lot of little checks.

ADVISOR: [00:09:34] Okay, let’s take those one at a time. Your own pension—the union one. What’s that from exactly?

CLIENT: [00:09:40] That’s the Southwest Electrical Workers Pension Fund. It was my union pension from Public Service Company of New Mexico. They send me just under twenty‑four hundred a month before tax.

ADVISOR: [00:09:52] And that’s a lifetime defined‑benefit pension, so paid every month as long as you’re alive?

CLIENT: [00:09:58] Yeah. They did a tiny cost‑of‑living bump a couple years ago, but otherwise it’s the same check.

ADVISOR: [00:10:05] Do they withhold federal taxes on that?

CLIENT: [00:10:08] Yeah, federal for sure. I think a bit of state too. My accountant said that one’s “fully taxable.”

ADVISOR: [00:10:15] Great. Next one—the survivor pension from Maria’s teaching. Who’s that with?

CLIENT: [00:10:21] That’s through New Mexico Teachers’ Retirement Association. Survivor pension. They send me around eleven hundred a month since she passed. It dropped from what she was getting.

ADVISOR: [00:10:32] And that continues for your lifetime?

CLIENT: [00:10:35] That’s what they told me. “As long as you’re alive.” Once I go, the kids don’t see any of that.

ADVISOR: [00:10:41] Understood. And then you mentioned something from TIAA as well?

CLIENT: [00:10:45] Yeah. Maria had a 403(b) through the college she taught at part‑time. TIAA turned part of it into a lifetime annuity for her. When she passed, I get a reduced amount. The statement calls it “TIAA Traditional – Lifetime Annuity.”

ADVISOR: [00:10:59] How much does that one pay you each month?

CLIENT: [00:11:02] About six hundred and fifty dollars. It used to be more when she was alive, but it dropped to the survivor rate. They say it’s guaranteed for my life, markets don’t matter.

ADVISOR: [00:11:12] Good. Any idea if there’s any benefit left for your children when you pass, or does it stop at your death?

CLIENT: [00:11:18] That’s the one I’m fuzzy on. They talked about “joint and survivor” and “ten‑year certain” when she set it up. We’re past ten years now, so I think it just stops when I go. The kids joke that that one “dies with Dad.”

ADVISOR: [00:11:29] We can confirm that with TIAA, but that sounds right. You also mentioned a smaller pension from a lab?

CLIENT: [00:11:36] Yeah, when I left Rocky Mountain Manufacturing they’d been bought by a lab outfit. There’s a small pension that pays me, I think, five hundred‑something a month. Not huge, but it covers groceries.

ADVISOR: [00:11:47] And there’s a tiny union annuity as well, correct?

CLIENT: [00:11:50] Oh yeah, I forget that one. That’s about ninety bucks a month. That one just shows up and I don’t think about it.

ADVISOR: [00:11:57] Okay. Then Social Security. When did you start that?

CLIENT: [00:12:01] At sixty‑six and some months, the “full” age they told me. So four, five years ago now.

ADVISOR: [00:12:08] And roughly how much are you getting each month from Social Security?

CLIENT: [00:12:12] About twenty‑two hundred. It went up in January with the cost‑of‑living thing.

ADVISOR: [00:12:18] Are you having any tax withheld from Social Security, or do you take the full amount?

CLIENT: [00:12:23] I take the full amount. My accountant said with what they’re already withholding from the pensions and the IRA money, we could leave Social Security alone.

ADVISOR: [00:12:31] Makes sense. For planning purposes, some of that will end up taxable based on your other income, but we don’t need the formula today. Between those pensions and Social Security, what do you see hitting your bank account in an average month, after tax?

CLIENT: [00:12:45] Net‑net, it’s a bit over five thousand. Depends on the withholding, but that’s the ballpark.

ADVISOR: [00:12:52] And that five‑plus thousand is plenty to cover your regular bills, before we even talk about IRA withdrawals?

CLIENT: [00:12:58] Yeah. The basics are covered. It’s the extras—travel, helping the kids—that I keep my eye on.


ADVISOR: [00:13:11] We’ll circle back to the IRAs in a moment. Before we do, let’s get a feel for your day‑to‑day spending. Roughly what do you think you spend in an average month, all in?

CLIENT: [00:13:20] I’ve tried to add it up a few times. I’d say somewhere between three and a half, maybe four thousand a month. Something in that range. I don’t have it written down exactly.

ADVISOR: [00:13:32] That’s fine. We’ll break it into buckets. Housing first. No mortgage, but you’ve got property tax, utilities, insurance, internet. About how much are those together if you average them across the year?

CLIENT: [00:13:44] Property tax is, like I said, around thirty‑five hundred a year. Insurance maybe eight hundred. Gas and electric together, maybe one fifty a month. Water and garbage, sixty, seventy. Internet and cable—just under two hundred. When you add it all, I’d say around a thousand, maybe eleven hundred a month.

ADVISOR: [00:14:03] So call it about eleven hundred for housing‑type bills. Then food. Groceries and household supplies?

CLIENT: [00:14:10] Groceries… I’m not feeding a family of four anymore. I’d say five to six hundred a month. Depends if the kids come over for dinner a lot. I buy more when the grandkids are around.

ADVISOR: [00:14:20] And eating out—restaurants, coffee, take‑out?

CLIENT: [00:14:24] I do that more now. Maybe two hundred, some months it creeps up to three. I meet my buddies for breakfast a couple times a week.

ADVISOR: [00:14:32] Are those meals out something you could cut back on if you needed to?

CLIENT: [00:14:36] Yeah, I could. I wouldn’t like it, but it’s not like the electric bill.

ADVISOR: [00:14:42] How about transportation—gas, maintenance, insurance on your car?

CLIENT: [00:14:47] Car’s paid off. Gas is maybe a hundred, hundred‑twenty a month. Insurance around seven hundred a year. I put some aside for oil changes and such—maybe five hundred a year. So another hundred‑plus a month if you average it.

ADVISOR: [00:15:01] Health‑related expenses—Medicare, supplement, prescriptions?

CLIENT: [00:15:06] Medicare Part B comes out of my Social Security, so I don’t really “see” it. My supplement I pay directly—around two hundred and something a month. Then a drug plan, maybe forty. Co‑pays on meds, fifty, sixty. And I try to keep some money aside in case I need dental work. That’s always more than you think.

ADVISOR: [00:15:22] So healthcare’s firmly in the “essential” bucket for you.

CLIENT: [00:15:26] Yeah. Can’t gamble with that. My parents lived a long time, lots of doctor visits.

ADVISOR: [00:15:33] You mentioned when we booked this that you help out with childcare for your grandkids. How much is that?

CLIENT: [00:15:39] Daycare’s ridiculous. For my daughter’s two, it’s close to fifteen hundred a month. I pay about half. So seven hundred, seven‑fifty each month, straight to the daycare.

ADVISOR: [00:15:50] And you see that as a promise you’ve made for a while?

CLIENT: [00:15:54] Yeah. The older one starts kindergarten next fall, so maybe eighteen months more at this level. After that I’ll still help, just not as much. I’d cut travel before I’d stop paying that.

ADVISOR: [00:16:05] Speaking of travel, how often are you taking trips and what do you think you spend per year?

CLIENT: [00:16:10] I try to do one bigger trip and a couple smaller ones. Last year I went to Portland to see my sister, my son flew me to Boston, and I did a cruise down to Mexico with some friends. All in, maybe four to five thousand over the year.

ADVISOR: [00:16:24] And you see travel as more of a “nice to have”—flexible if you needed to cut back?

CLIENT: [00:16:28] Exactly. It’s my fun money.

ADVISOR: [00:16:33] If we add up your essentials—housing around eleven hundred, food maybe seven or eight hundred including some eating out, healthcare three hundredish, car maybe a hundred and change, plus seven‑something for daycare—does that feel like it gets you around three‑and‑a‑half thousand a month for the must‑do items?

CLIENT: [00:16:51] Yeah, that sounds about right. Somewhere in that neighborhood.

ADVISOR: [00:16:56] And then travel, gifts, hobbies, breakfasts with friends—that’s what takes you up toward four thousand when you’re not being especially frugal.

CLIENT: [00:17:04] Exactly. If I stayed home and ate beans, I could live on less. But I’m seventy‑one; I’d like to still enjoy myself.

ADVISOR: [00:17:12] Completely reasonable.


ADVISOR: [00:17:26] Let’s move back to the savings and investments that sit behind all this. We’ve talked about your income and spending; now I want to understand the pots you’ve built up. Can we start with your day‑to‑day bank accounts—where do your pensions and Social Security land?

CLIENT: [00:17:38] They all go into my checking at Rio Grande Credit Union. That’s my main bill‑pay account.

ADVISOR: [00:17:45] Roughly how much do you tend to keep in that checking account?

CLIENT: [00:17:49] Usually six to eight thousand. I don’t like it going under five. That gives me a buffer for the odd big bill.

ADVISOR: [00:17:56] Do you have a separate savings account or money market there?

CLIENT: [00:18:00] Yeah, I’ve got a savings there too. Last time I looked it was around thirty‑two thousand. That’s my “if the roof leaks” money.

ADVISOR: [00:18:10] Good emergency fund. You also mentioned an inheritance when we scheduled this. Where is that money now?

CLIENT: [00:18:17] When my mom passed three years ago, I got around a hundred twenty after everything. I didn’t want to rush, so most of it’s just been sitting in an online account at Ally Bank. High‑yield savings.

ADVISOR: [00:18:28] Roughly how much is still there now?

CLIENT: [00:18:32] Pretty close. I took a bit out when I bought the new car and for some home stuff, so maybe it’s a hundred and ten now.

ADVISOR: [00:18:40] Any portion of that in CDs or is it all in the high‑yield savings?

CLIENT: [00:18:44] I did one CD—twelve‑month, ten thousand, started in April. At about five percent. Ally said it’ll be around ten‑five, ten‑six when it matures next April.

ADVISOR: [00:18:55] When that CD matures, do you have a plan? Roll it again, or earmark it for something?

CLIENT: [00:19:01] I was thinking maybe move it into something for the grandkids. Like one of those college accounts my daughter mentioned. A 5‑2‑something? I don’t really know the rules, that’s why I’m talking to you.

ADVISOR: [00:19:11] A 529 college plan, probably. We can walk through how those work and what it would mean for you versus just gifting cash. Outside of the Ally account and that CD, any other larger cash pots—CDs at the credit union, for example?

CLIENT: [00:19:23] I do have a couple CDs at Rio Grande from when my sister died and left me a bit. Nothing huge—together maybe thirty thousand. One comes due this fall, the other next year.

ADVISOR: [00:19:35] When those mature, have you been rolling them, or using them?

CLIENT: [00:19:40] So far I’ve just rolled them. I figured that’s safer. But the plumbing in the house needs work, so I might use the one this fall for that instead of touching the IRA.

ADVISOR: [00:19:49] That makes sense—using cash first to avoid bumping up taxable IRA withdrawals.


ADVISOR: [00:20:02] Let’s talk about your retirement accounts—the IRAs and anything left at TIAA. What’s the main pot you think of when you think “my retirement investments”?

CLIENT: [00:20:11] My own IRA, I guess. The one that came from my 403(b) and 401(k)s. For years it was at Fidelity; recently we moved it to Vanguard because my son liked their funds. That’s kind of the big one.

ADVISOR: [00:20:22] Okay, so now a traditional IRA at Vanguard that used to be a Fidelity rollover. Roughly how much is in there across those consolidated accounts?

CLIENT: [00:20:31] Last time I looked, it was high four hundreds. About four hundred eighty‑something thousand. It moves around with the market.

ADVISOR: [00:20:40] And that came from your city plan and your earlier jobs?

CLIENT: [00:20:44] Yeah. When I retired from the city and from the utility before that, we rolled the 403(b) and 401(k) bits into that IRA.

ADVISOR: [00:20:51] Are you still adding anything to it, or just taking required minimum distributions now?

CLIENT: [00:20:56] Just the required stuff. Before I retired, I was putting in a couple hundred a month. That stopped when the paychecks stopped.

ADVISOR: [00:21:03] How are you taking your RMD from that Vanguard IRA?

CLIENT: [00:21:07] Vanguard sends me a notice each year. I split it into monthly payments—about fifteen hundred a month between that and a little from the inherited one. It just goes into checking.

ADVISOR: [00:21:18] So that RMD is part of your regular cash‑flow now, on top of pensions and Social Security.

CLIENT: [00:21:22] Yeah. Honestly, I don’t really need it for bills. I often move some of it straight back into savings.

ADVISOR: [00:21:29] You mentioned an inherited IRA from Maria as well.

CLIENT: [00:21:33] Yes. Her old 401(k) from the hospital she worked at years ago—we rolled that into an inherited IRA at Vanguard when she died. It’s smaller, maybe ninety, ninety‑five thousand.

ADVISOR: [00:21:44] And are you taking required minimum distributions from that inherited IRA?

CLIENT: [00:21:48] Yeah. They told me I had to. Last year I took just over five thousand. I usually do it in November to pay the property taxes on the house.

ADVISOR: [00:21:58] With about ten percent federal tax withheld?

CLIENT: [00:22:01] Right. That’s what they set up. No state withholding on that one.

ADVISOR: [00:22:06] Any other retirement accounts still sitting invested—like a 403(b) from Maria at TIAA?

CLIENT: [00:22:11] There is a leftover TIAA account that’s not annuitized. A supplemental 403(b) from when she taught at the university. I don’t touch it. Last time I looked it was in the low forties—forty‑two, forty‑three thousand.

ADVISOR: [00:22:23] And that one’s still invested in funds, not paying a monthly income?

CLIENT: [00:22:27] Exactly. It jumps around. One year it was close to fifty, then dropped into the high thirties, now back in the forties. I’ve kind of mentally earmarked that for the kids.

ADVISOR: [00:22:36] On beneficiary designations—who’s listed on your Vanguard IRA?

CLIENT: [00:22:41] My two kids, fifty‑fifty. My son, Mark, and my daughter, Elena. I updated that after Maria passed.

ADVISOR: [00:22:48] And on the inherited IRA from Maria and the TIAA 403(b), do you believe Mark and Elena are beneficiaries there as well?

CLIENT: [00:22:55] I’m pretty sure. I remember filling out forms online with their names. TIAA has like three different account numbers; I get mixed up. I’d like help double‑checking that.

ADVISOR: [00:23:05] We can definitely go through the statements together when we meet.


ADVISOR: [00:23:18] Aside from the IRAs and TIAA, do you have any regular brokerage accounts—non‑retirement investments?

CLIENT: [00:23:24] I’ve got an Edward Jones account I always forget about.

ADVISOR: [00:23:28] What’s in the Edward Jones account?

CLIENT: [00:23:31] It came from my uncle. A bunch of utility stock—Public Service Company of New Mexico. They just send dividends. Last time I checked, it was maybe thirty, thirty‑five thousand.

ADVISOR: [00:23:41] Are the dividends reinvested, or do they go to your checking?

CLIENT: [00:23:45] Reinvested. I never changed it.

ADVISOR: [00:23:48] Any other investments? Old annuities with cash value, small accounts with previous advisors?

CLIENT: [00:23:54] Not really. There was a small annuity my union set up, but that’s the ninety‑dollars‑a‑month one, so I don’t think of it as an account anymore. And I’ve got some of those old paper savings bonds in a shoebox.

ADVISOR: [00:24:05] Do you know the face value on the savings bonds?

CLIENT: [00:24:09] Most say fifty dollars, a few say a hundred. Maybe twenty or thirty of them total. They’re pretty old—from the eighties.

ADVISOR: [00:24:18] So maybe one to two thousand in face value, probably worth more now with the interest. Any life insurance policies still in force on you?

CLIENT: [00:24:25] Just a small one from the state. Ten thousand. That’s just to cover burial so the kids don’t have to worry.

ADVISOR: [00:24:31] Okay. Anything else significant on the asset side—timeshares, rental properties, business interests?

CLIENT: [00:24:38] No timeshares. Learned my lesson from a buddy who bought one. No businesses. Just the house, the cabin share, the cash, and the retirement stuff we talked about.


ADVISOR: [00:24:53] Let’s touch briefly on borrowing. Do you have any debts at the moment—mortgages, car loans, credit cards you carry a balance on?

CLIENT: [00:25:01] No. House is paid off. Car’s paid off. I put things on the card for points, but I pay it off every month. I’m old‑school about that.

ADVISOR: [00:25:09] Ever had a home equity line or anything secured against the house?

CLIENT: [00:25:13] No. We thought about one years back when we did the last big remodel, but we just saved up instead.

ADVISOR: [00:25:21] And I have to ask, have you ever looked seriously at reverse mortgages?

CLIENT: [00:25:25] They send me flyers every week. “Use your home to retire better,” free lunch at the senior center and all that. I went to one lunch thing—got a sandwich, didn’t like the pitch. Too salesy.

ADVISOR: [00:25:36] So at this stage you’d see a reverse mortgage as a last‑resort tool rather than something you want to do now.

CLIENT: [00:25:41] Exactly. Maybe if I was ninety and out of money. Right now, between the pensions and the savings I inherited, I’d rather just keep it simple.


ADVISOR: [00:25:57] You mentioned earlier you want to get your will and powers of attorney sorted. Do you have a will in place at the moment?

CLIENT: [00:26:03] I do. We drew up a simple will in, I think, twenty‑sixteen, just after Maria died. It leaves the house and my savings split between my son and daughter.

ADVISOR: [00:26:13] Does it mention the money you later inherited from your mom and sister?

CLIENT: [00:26:17] No, it doesn’t. That came later. It just sort of says “all the rest” to them, but it doesn’t talk about specific accounts.

ADVISOR: [00:26:24] Any trusts set up, or is it just that straightforward will?

CLIENT: [00:26:28] Just the will. No trusts. I’ve got a health care directive with my doctor, but no formal financial power of attorney yet. That’s part of what’s worrying me.

ADVISOR: [00:26:37] Who would you imagine naming as your financial power of attorney if, say, you couldn’t manage things for a period?

CLIENT: [00:26:43] Probably my son, Mark. He’s good with numbers. My daughter, Elena, would be backup. I just haven’t put it on paper.

ADVISOR: [00:26:51] And for your executor, same idea?

CLIENT: [00:26:54] Yeah, same. I’ve talked to them in general terms. They know I want things split fifty‑fifty and as simple as possible.

ADVISOR: [00:27:01] When would you ideally like those documents—updated will, power of attorney, maybe something around the grandkids—done by?

CLIENT: [00:27:07] I’d like it all done in the next six months if we can. I don’t want them guessing what to do if something happens to me.

ADVISOR: [00:27:14] That’s very doable. We can coordinate with an attorney or work with yours if you already have one.

CLIENT: [00:27:20] The attorney we used when Maria died has probably retired by now, so I’m open.


ADVISOR: [00:27:33] Coming back to your goals for the money itself—when you think about the house, the cabin share, your savings, and the IRAs, what feels most important? Protecting and preserving what you have, trying to grow it, or mostly making sure it passes smoothly to your kids?

CLIENT: [00:27:47] I’d say protect it and make it simple for them. I don’t need to double it at my age. I just wanna know I won’t run out, and then whatever’s left goes to the kids without a big mess.

ADVISOR: [00:27:57] How do you feel about investment risk for that? If the value of your accounts went up and down over the next few years, what would make you uncomfortable?

CLIENT: [00:28:05] I’m on the cautious side. I don’t want it all just sitting in cash, ’cause I know prices keep going up. But if it dropped by ten or fifteen percent in a bad year, I’d be pretty uncomfortable. I can live with a small wobble if there’s a plan, but I don’t want big swings.

ADVISOR: [00:28:20] So no high‑octane stuff. More steady and predictable.

CLIENT: [00:28:24] Yeah. And if it’s money I might need for long‑term care or something, I’d like that part steadier than the bit that’s mainly for the kids.

ADVISOR: [00:28:33] That’s a really helpful distinction. After our call I’ll send you a short risk questionnaire—plain English, no fancy graphs—to make sure what I’m hearing matches the numbers.

CLIENT: [00:28:42] Okay. As long as it’s not one of those slider things that makes you feel like you’re flying a spaceship, I’ll be alright.


ADVISOR: [00:28:56] I want to circle back to a couple of specific things you mentioned earlier. First, helping your grandkids with college. You said your eldest granddaughter starts in about three years?

CLIENT: [00:29:04] Yeah. Sofia’s a sophomore in high school now, so three years give or take. The younger ones are eight and six, so they’ve got a ways to go.

ADVISOR: [00:29:13] In your mind, what would “helping” look like? Covering all tuition, or more like a set amount each year?

CLIENT: [00:29:19] I’m thinking a set amount. Maybe, I don’t know, five thousand a year while they’re in school? Enough to make a difference but not so much they don’t appreciate it. I’d like to do something similar for the younger ones, maybe smaller if I’m older by then.

ADVISOR: [00:29:33] Would you want that to start from your current cash—like the Ally savings—or are you okay earmarking part of your IRA withdrawals for it later?

CLIENT: [00:29:40] I’d prefer to use the inheritance cash if I can. I kinda see the IRA as more “my” money and the Ally stuff as “Mom’s” money. Feels right to use that to help the next generation.

ADVISOR: [00:29:51] That makes sense emotionally. We can look at using some of the Ally balance or that maturing CD to seed a 529 plan, and then top up from your income each year as needed.

CLIENT: [00:30:00] Yeah, I’d like to keep it separate so I don’t accidentally spend it on cruises.


ADVISOR: [00:30:13] Another thing you mentioned earlier was maybe doing something for your son directly—like a Roth IRA for him. Tell me more about that thought.

CLIENT: [00:30:20] Well, he’s forty‑five, works hard, but I don’t think he saves as much as he could. I thought maybe I could put something into a Roth for him out of the inheritance, but I don’t know if that’s allowed.

ADVISOR: [00:30:30] It’s a really common question. With a Roth IRA, the contribution technically has to come from the person’s own earned income, but you can gift him money and he can use that to make the contribution, as long as he has enough income to cover it.

CLIENT: [00:30:41] Ah, okay. So I can’t open it *as* him, but I can sort of fuel it.

ADVISOR: [00:30:45] Exactly. Another route is 529 for the grandkids, like we discussed, which is in your name but for their benefit. We’ll look at the pros and cons of each later.

CLIENT: [00:30:54] Got it. I don’t wanna do anything that makes their taxes worse, you know?

ADVISOR: [00:30:59] That brings me to taxes. Your accountant’s said you’re in a lower bracket now. Do you remember roughly where you are—around the twelve percent, twenty‑two percent range?

CLIENT: [00:31:08] Last year he said we’re in the twenty‑two percent bracket, but “comfortably,” whatever that means. He said we had some room before the next one.

ADVISOR: [00:31:16] That’s useful. It opens up options, like maybe slowly converting a bit of your IRA to a Roth over a few years so that when the kids inherit, it’s more tax‑friendly. Not something we decide today, but something to consider.

CLIENT: [00:31:27] Yeah, someone told me if they inherit the IRA now, they’ve got ten years to pull it out.

ADVISOR: [00:31:32] That’s right under current rules for non‑spouse beneficiaries. So planning ahead on that front can really help them.


ADVISOR: [00:31:47] I’d like to revisit your monthly cash flow now that we’ve covered assets. You said your pensions and Social Security net out to a bit over five thousand a month, and your essential plus important extras—like daycare—run about three‑and‑a‑half to four thousand. That suggests you’ve got a buffer each month. What do you usually do with the surplus?

CLIENT: [00:32:02] Most months I end up with, I don’t know, six hundred to a thousand left sitting in checking. If it starts getting too fat, I move a chunk over to savings or Ally. Or I use it when the grandkids need something, like summer camp or braces.

ADVISOR: [00:32:15] Have you had to dip into your IRA principal at all beyond the required distributions?

CLIENT: [00:32:20] No. The only time I did a bigger IRA withdrawal was when I replaced the roof eight years ago. Lately, I cover big things from the CDs or the Ally account instead.

ADVISOR: [00:32:30] That’s great from a sustainability standpoint. It means your pensions and Social Security are doing the heavy lifting.

CLIENT: [00:32:35] Yeah, my son keeps saying, “Dad, you’re richer on paper than you think.” It doesn’t feel like that when you’re buying groceries, but I guess he has a point.


ADVISOR: [00:32:49] Talking of “on paper,” do you have any sense of the total picture—house, cabin share, investment accounts, cash—what that adds up to?

CLIENT: [00:32:57] I kind of did a back‑of‑the‑envelope once. House, say four‑twenty. My third of the cabin, maybe eighty. The IRA, high four hundreds. Inherited IRA and TIAA, call it one‑thirty. Cash and CDs, maybe one‑fifty with Ally and the credit union. Edward Jones, thirty‑something. So… over a million, I guess? Which sounds crazy to say out loud.

ADVISOR: [00:33:18] It’s not unusual for someone who’s been saving over a full career and has a paid‑off house. But it does mean we want to be thoughtful about taxes and how this all passes on.

CLIENT: [00:33:27] Yeah. Last thing I want is half of it going to the government because I didn’t fill out a form.


ADVISOR: [00:33:42] On that note, I want to check something practical: if something happened tomorrow and you couldn’t make decisions for a while, who knows where everything is? Do Mark and Elena know about the Ally account, the IRAs, the cabin?

CLIENT: [00:33:54] They know most of it. We did a sort of kitchen‑table meeting after Maria died. I showed them the file drawer where I keep statements. I don’t think they know about the old savings bonds or the tiny union annuity, but that’s small stuff.

ADVISOR: [00:34:07] Would you be open to putting together a one‑ or two‑page “roadmap” for them—just listing accounts and contacts—so they’re not hunting through shoeboxes?

CLIENT: [00:34:13] Yeah, I’d actually like that. I started one in a notebook but it’s messy. If you have a template, that’d be great.

ADVISOR: [00:34:19] We do. We’ll use that when we meet.


ADVISOR: [00:34:32] I also want to ask about long‑term care or assisted living, since you mentioned maybe moving later in life. Have you thought about what kind of place you’d want and how you’d fund it if needed?

CLIENT: [00:34:40] I’ve visited a couple places with church friends. Some are nice, some feel like hotels. I haven’t priced it seriously, but I know it’s not cheap. My thinking was, if it comes to that, I’d sell the house and use that plus my pensions to cover it.

ADVISOR: [00:34:54] That’s a common approach—house value as a back‑up pot. Do you have any long‑term care insurance?

CLIENT: [00:35:00] No. We looked at it when Maria was first diagnosed, but by then it was too expensive.

ADVISOR: [00:35:06] Okay. So we want to make sure your investments are structured so that, if you do need care in, say, ten or fifteen years, you’ve got liquid assets and aren’t forced to sell at a bad time in the market.

CLIENT: [00:35:15] Right. I don’t wanna be in a position where I have to cash out when everything’s down.


ADVISOR: [00:35:29] I’m going to loop back quickly to one account we haven’t talked much about: your Schw—actually, let me check—do you have any other brokerage accounts besides Edward Jones?

CLIENT: [00:35:37] Not now. Years ago Maria and I had a Schwab account with some mutual funds, but we closed that and rolled things into the Vanguard IRA when we simplified. So Edward Jones is the only taxable investment one left.

ADVISOR: [00:35:47] Perfect, that keeps things simpler.


ADVISOR: [00:35:59] We’ve covered a lot of ground. I’d like to spend the last part of our time today just clarifying how you feel about using your money over the next ten or fifteen years. On a spectrum from “I want to spend down and enjoy it” to “I want to preserve as much as possible for the kids,” where do you feel you sit?

CLIENT: [00:36:13] Somewhere in the middle. I don’t mind spending a bit more now on travel while I’m still spry, but I’d feel bad if I blew through it and left them with nothing. Especially since some of it came from my mom and Maria.

ADVISOR: [00:36:25] Would you be comfortable if, say, you gradually drew down your investments so that by your late eighties or nineties you still had a healthy cushion but not quite as much earmarked for the kids?

CLIENT: [00:36:34] Yeah, as long as I’m not risking having to move in with them. They’ve got their own kids and lives.

ADVISOR: [00:36:42] Absolutely. Based on what you’ve told me—no debt, strong pension and Social Security income, a paid‑off home, and seven‑figure total assets—we have a lot of flexibility. The main constraints are tax and making things administratively easy for Mark and Elena.

CLIENT: [00:36:55] That’s reassuring to hear.


ADVISOR: [00:37:08] Is there anything we haven’t talked about yet that’s been nagging at you? Any “what if” scenarios that keep you up at night?

CLIENT: [00:37:14] I worry about two things. One, if there’s some big market crash and my IRA drops right when I need to move into assisted living. And two, if I get dementia or something and start making dumb decisions.

ADVISOR: [00:37:27] On the first one, that’s where the mix between safer investments and growth comes in, and having enough cash or bonds to ride out a downturn. On the second, that’s where the power of attorney and having Mark and Elena looped in really matters.

CLIENT: [00:37:38] Yeah, I told them if I start wiring money to “princes” in some other country, they have my permission to take away my checkbook.

ADVISOR: [00:37:45] That’s a good family rule. We’ll build your plan assuming you want protection, steady income, some growth to keep up with inflation, and clarity for your kids.

CLIENT: [00:37:54] That sounds about right.


ADVISOR: [00:38:07] Over the next few days I’m going to send you two things: that risk questionnaire we talked about, and a short list of documents and statements it would be helpful for you to gather—things like your latest IRA and Ally statements, your TIAA paperwork, and your existing will if you can find it.

CLIENT: [00:38:20] I’ve got a shoebox and a file drawer. I’ll dig them out. Might take me a weekend, but I’ll get there.

ADVISOR: [00:38:27] No rush. When we meet in person, we’ll go line by line through the accounts, confirm beneficiaries, and sketch out some options—for example, how much to put toward a 529 for Sofia, whether to adjust your IRA investments to better match your comfort with risk, and how to structure your will and powers of attorney.

CLIENT: [00:38:42] Okay. It’ll be good to have it all in one place instead of in my head.

ADVISOR: [00:38:48] And we’ll also model what your income and spending look like over the next twenty years—factoring in when the daycare help drops off, when travel might slow down, and what assisted living could cost if you choose that later on.

CLIENT: [00:38:58] I like the sound of that. I just wanna know I’m not gonna be a burden, and that the kids don’t have a big mess to clean up.

ADVISOR: [00:39:05] That’s exactly what this kind of planning is for.

CLIENT: [00:39:09] Alright. Let’s do it.
