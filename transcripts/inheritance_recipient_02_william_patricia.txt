================================================================================

ADVISOR: [00:00:03] William, Patricia, thanks for jumping on today. I know getting an inheritance and trying to use it for early retirement can feel like a lot all at once, so we’ll just take it step by step.  

Before anything else, can I confirm your full names and dates of birth for my system?

CLIENT1: [00:00:18] Yeah, sure. It’s William James Davis. Davis, D‑A‑V‑I‑S. My birthday is March twenty‑second, nineteen seventy‑eight.  

CLIENT2: [00:00:31] And I’m Patricia Anne Davis. Most people call me Trish. My date of birth is the fifth of November, nineteen eighty‑eight.

ADVISOR: [00:00:44] Perfect, thank you. And you’re married to each other?

CLIENT2: [00:00:49] Yes, married. We’ve been… what is it now… seven years?  

CLIENT1: [00:00:54] Yeah, coming up on eight. Feels longer in a good way.  

ADVISOR: [00:01:00] Good to hear. For contact details, William, what’s the best mobile number for you? I’ll use it to text the risk questionnaire and a secure upload link after the call.

CLIENT1: [00:01:08] My cell is 303‑555‑0194. If you text that, it comes straight to me.  

ADVISOR: [00:01:17] Got it, 303 ending 0194. Trish, if we ever need you directly?

CLIENT2: [00:01:22] Mine’s 720‑555‑6630. But for money stuff I’d say call him first. I get stuck in sessions a lot.  

ADVISOR: [00:01:31] Understood. I’ll put William as primary, you as secondary.  

I also need to ask a tiny bit about health, because it feeds into what ages make sense for retirement and whether insurance is an issue. William, how would you describe your general health?

CLIENT1: [00:01:45] Pretty good. I run a couple times a week. Had a knee scope about five years ago, but no ongoing issues. No blood pressure meds, no diabetes, nothing like that.  

ADVISOR: [00:01:56] Any family history that worries you? Heart, stroke, anything significant?

CLIENT1: [00:02:01] My dad had heart problems later in life, but I’ve been okay so far. I get checked yearly.  

ADVISOR: [00:02:07] Okay. And Trish, how about you?

CLIENT2: [00:02:10] Generally fine. I get migraines now and then but they’re controlled with meds. I do yoga. I’m not, you know, a triathlete, but I’m okay.  

ADVISOR: [00:02:20] Do either of you smoke or use nicotine? Vapes, patches, anything like that?

CLIENT1: [00:02:25] No, never smoked.  

CLIENT2: [00:02:27] I did a bit in college but stopped like fifteen years ago. Nothing since.  

ADVISOR: [00:02:34] Perfect, non‑smokers. That all helps when we’re thinking about longer time horizons.  

Given the inheritance, I know early retirement is a big theme. In your heads, what ages are you hoping to step away from full‑time work?

CLIENT1: [00:02:47] For me, I’d love to be done mid‑fifties. I’m forty‑six now, so somewhere between fifty‑five and late fifties. The number that’s been in my head is fifty‑seven.  

CLIENT2: [00:02:59] And I’m ten years behind him, so I’ve been saying early fifties. Maybe fifty‑two, fifty‑three. Or we just aim to stop the same year so we actually see each other.  

ADVISOR: [00:03:10] Okay, so roughly eleven to fifteen years away, depending. When you picture that stage, with the kids older and ideally the house paid off, what sort of monthly income in today’s dollars feels comfortable?

CLIENT2: [00:03:23] We’ve talked about that a bit. I think around five to six thousand a month after tax would feel okay. That’s assuming the mortgage is gone and no daycare.  

CLIENT1: [00:03:33] Yeah, somewhere in that range. We don’t need crazy money, but we don’t want to be scraping by. We’d like to travel a bit, see Europe, visit family, that sort of thing.  

ADVISOR: [00:03:43] So call it maybe seventy to eighty thousand a year in today’s terms, once the big stuff drops away. We’ll refine that, but it gives us a target.  

On the flip side, if markets misbehaved or something health‑wise cropped up later, how flexible are those ages? Are fifty‑seven and early‑fifties absolute, or could you slide a bit?

CLIENT2: [00:03:59] I’d like to be done by fifty‑two, but realistically I could probably go to fifty‑five if we had to. I just really don’t want to be sixty and still doing school crisis meetings.  

CLIENT1: [00:04:10] Same. Fifty‑seven is the dream. Sixty would be my absolute max. The whole point of the inheritance, for me, is not working into my sixties unless we really have to.  

ADVISOR: [00:04:21] That’s helpful—gives us goalposts and a backup range.  

Before we dig into the inheritance itself, I want to get a sense of your work and what’s coming in now. William, what’s your current role and who do you work for?

CLIENT1: [00:04:32] I’m an operations manager at Redwood Engineering Services. It’s a regional engineering and logistics company just outside Denver. I manage one of the distribution centers.  

ADVISOR: [00:04:43] Full‑time employee there, W‑2?

CLIENT1: [00:04:46] Yeah. Salary, W‑2, benefits, all that.  

ADVISOR: [00:04:49] And roughly what do you earn there in a year, before tax?

CLIENT1: [00:04:54] Base is around ninety‑five grand. If we have a good year, bonus can add another, I don’t know, eight to twelve. Last year my W‑2 was just under one‑ten.  

ADVISOR: [00:05:06] Got it. Paid biweekly, taxes withheld, and you’re contributing to the 401(k) there?

CLIENT1: [00:05:12] Yeah, biweekly direct deposit. I’m putting in ten percent to the 401(k). They match four.  

ADVISOR: [00:05:19] Nice match. Trish, what about you—what’s your main job?

CLIENT2: [00:05:23] I’m a school counselor at Eastwood High School. Three days a week. And then I do some private college‑prep coaching on the side—mostly weekends and evenings.  

ADVISOR: [00:05:32] Is Eastwood part of the Riverside district?

CLIENT2: [00:05:35] Yeah, Riverside School District.  

ADVISOR: [00:05:37] Income‑wise from the school and the side work?

CLIENT2: [00:05:41] From the district, my salary is about thirty‑two, thirty‑three thousand. The private coaching is irregular, maybe another five or six thousand a year when it’s busy.  

ADVISOR: [00:05:52] Okay, so combined you’re somewhere in the low to mid one‑hundreds before tax. Do you use an accountant or file on your own?

CLIENT1: [00:05:59] We have an accountant. He said last year we were kind of in the middle bracket and close to one of those child credit phase‑outs. I don’t remember the exact term.  

ADVISOR: [00:06:09] That sounds right for your income level. Any other income streams? Rentals, side gigs, anything like that?

CLIENT2: [00:06:16] I do a tiny bit of freelance stuff for a friend’s candle business—Instagram, photos. She pays me via Venmo, like fifty here, a hundred there. Last year she actually sent me a 1099‑NEC for about fifteen hundred.  

ADVISOR: [00:06:29] So a small self‑employment piece. And interest from the inheritance cash—have you noticed what that’s throwing off yet?

CLIENT1: [00:06:35] It’s in a high‑yield savings, so maybe a couple hundred a month in interest? We know that’s taxable too.  

ADVISOR: [00:06:42] Right, that’ll show up as interest income.  

Let me switch to what you own, starting with the house. This is the place you live in now?

CLIENT1: [00:06:51] Yeah. Three‑bedroom house in Fairview Heights, just outside Denver.  

CLIENT2: [00:06:56] Technically it’s Fairview Heights but the mailing address says Denver. We’re like ten minutes from the IKEA, if that helps.  

ADVISOR: [00:07:04] I know exactly where that is. Roughly what would the home sell for today, in your view?

CLIENT1: [00:07:10] Last time I checked Zillow it was showing high three hundreds. Maybe four‑ten. Somewhere in that range.  

CLIENT2: [00:07:17] The one across the street sold for just under four hundred last fall. Ours is a little bigger, so I’d say around the four‑hundred mark.  

ADVISOR: [00:07:24] Okay, let’s call it about four hundred thousand. Do you still have a mortgage on it?

CLIENT1: [00:07:29] Yeah, definitely. We thought about paying it off with the inheritance but haven’t.  

ADVISOR: [00:07:34] Ballpark, how much is left on that mortgage?

CLIENT1: [00:07:37] About one‑eighty, maybe a bit under. We refinanced during the low‑rate thing.  

CLIENT2: [00:07:43] The payment’s like fifteen‑something a month now, including property taxes and homeowners insurance.  

ADVISOR: [00:07:49] So roughly $1,550 with taxes and insurance escrowed?

CLIENT1: [00:07:53] Yeah, that’s about right.  

ADVISOR: [00:07:56] And how long left on the term if you just let it run?

CLIENT1: [00:07:59] I think it finishes when I’m early sixties, sixty‑three-ish.  

ADVISOR: [00:08:05] Okay, so on the current schedule you’d still be paying it in your early sixties. That ties straight into the early‑retirement discussion—we’ll come back to whether we shorten that or not.  

Any other real estate? Vacation place, land, rentals?

CLIENT2: [00:08:17] The cabin. Your mom’s cabin.  

CLIENT1: [00:08:19] Right, yeah. I inherited half of a cabin up in Iron Ridge, Michigan, from my mom.  

ADVISOR: [00:08:24] Half interest in a cabin in Iron Ridge. Is that on a lake?

CLIENT1: [00:08:28] It’s on Lake Iron Ridge, small lake. Nothing fancy.  

CLIENT2: [00:08:32] There’s a little association, like seventy‑some units. Not condos exactly, they’re all little cabins.  

ADVISOR: [00:08:38] Got it. You own fifty percent; who owns the other half?

CLIENT1: [00:08:42] My sister. We split everything when Mom passed.  

ADVISOR: [00:08:45] Any mortgage or loan on that cabin?

CLIENT1: [00:08:47] No, it’s free and clear. My parents had paid it off years ago.  

CLIENT2: [00:08:51] We just pay the yearly association dues and property tax.  

ADVISOR: [00:08:55] Rough value for your share, even just a range?

CLIENT1: [00:08:58] We had it appraised for probate. The whole place came in a bit over two‑twenty. So my half, call it around a hundred‑ten, hundred‑twenty.  

ADVISOR: [00:09:07] Okay, so roughly $110k for your half. Do you rent it out or is it just family use?

CLIENT2: [00:09:11] Right now it’s just family and friends. We’ve talked about Airbnb, but then we argue about who cleans it.  

CLIENT1: [00:09:17] Yeah, we haven’t pulled the trigger on renting it yet.  

ADVISOR: [00:09:21] Totally understandable. We can treat it as a lifestyle asset for now, with the option to generate income later if you want.  

Let’s talk about the inheritance itself. After everything settled, approximately how much did you receive between you?

CLIENT1: [00:09:33] Between my mom and then Patricia’s grandfather, it was somewhere between four‑fifty and five hundred thousand total.  

CLIENT2: [00:09:40] Yeah, mid‑four hundreds after lawyer fees and everything.  

ADVISOR: [00:09:45] And where is that money sitting right now?

CLIENT1: [00:09:48] So, we moved a big chunk into a high‑yield savings at Ally. That’s maybe, I don’t know, two‑eighty, two‑ninety.  

CLIENT2: [00:09:57] Plus there’s like forty in our regular checking at First National, which is too much, I know.  

ADVISOR: [00:10:03] Okay, so roughly three‑twenty between high‑yield savings and checking. Is there still some money in an estate or settlement account?

CLIENT1: [00:10:11] Yeah. There’s a settlement account at the law firm’s bank. That’s got around a hundred left. We’re waiting on one more small distribution.  

CLIENT2: [00:10:19] They said we should have the rest, like twenty‑something thousand, by March next year.  

ADVISOR: [00:10:25] Got it—final piece by next March. And your plan is to move that remaining amount into the high‑yield savings as well, at least initially?

CLIENT1: [00:10:31] For now, yeah. Then slowly into investments. We talked about using some for Roth IRAs.  

CLIENT2: [00:10:37] And maybe a brokerage account so we can retire early—late fifties for him, early fifties for me.  

ADVISOR: [00:10:43] Makes sense. Do you also keep a separate emergency fund outside of that inheritance money, or has it all sort of merged?

CLIENT2: [00:10:49] We had about fifteen thousand before all this. That’s still in a separate savings at our credit union.  

CLIENT1: [00:10:54] We’re trying not to mix it mentally, you know?  

ADVISOR: [00:10:58] I like that. For planning purposes I’ll count it all as cash, but we’ll keep the “buckets” separate in the way we think about it—emergency vs inheritance vs day‑to‑day.  

Let’s pause the assets there and look at what it costs to run the household now. That tells us how big your future “paycheck” from investments needs to be. When you think of the stuff that goes out every month—before holidays and fun—what comes to mind?

CLIENT1: [00:11:18] Main one is the mortgage. Like I said, about fifteen‑fifty a month. It jumps a bit with escrow adjustments.  

CLIENT2: [00:11:25] Yeah, it was one five three eight last month. I checked the app this morning.  

ADVISOR: [00:11:31] And that includes property tax and homeowners insurance?

CLIENT1: [00:11:34] Yeah, all bundled.  

ADVISOR: [00:11:37] Then on top of that, things like utilities, internet, cell phones—what do those “keep the lights on” bills run in a month, roughly?

CLIENT2: [00:11:45] I should’ve brought the spreadsheet.  

CLIENT1: [00:11:48] We have one, just not in front of us.  

CLIENT2: [00:11:50] Property tax’s in the mortgage. Utilities… gas and electric together maybe one eighty in summer, over two hundred in winter. Water’s forty to sixty. Internet’s about ninety. Phones are, what, one twenty for the two of us.  

CLIENT1: [00:12:03] And trash, Netflix, Spotify—by the time you add all the silly subscriptions it’s probably close to a thousand a month total outside the mortgage.  

ADVISOR: [00:12:12] So core household bills around a thousand plus the mortgage. Are those things you feel are basically non‑negotiable?

CLIENT2: [00:12:19] Yeah. I mean, we could cut some streaming services and maybe drop our phone plans, but mortgage, utilities, that’s just life.  

ADVISOR: [00:12:26] Okay, we’ll treat those as essentials. Childcare is usually a big one at your stage. Walk me through that?

CLIENT2: [00:12:32] Yeah, that’s the killer.  

CLIENT1: [00:12:34] We’ve got two kids. Ethan is seven, Mia just turned four.  

CLIENT2: [00:12:38] Mia’s in daycare four full days a week. We pay after the “free” hours—about eight‑fifty a month.  

CLIENT1: [00:12:45] Yeah, between eight and nine hundred depending on lunches and extra stuff.  

ADVISOR: [00:12:49] And for Ethan, is there after‑school care?

CLIENT2: [00:12:51] He goes to the after‑school club three days a week. That’s like one‑sixty, one‑seventy. I round it to two hundred.  

CLIENT1: [00:12:59] So together childcare is roughly just over a thousand a month.  

ADVISOR: [00:13:04] How long do you expect to be at that level?

CLIENT2: [00:13:07] Mia starts kindergarten next fall, so just over a year of full daycare.  

CLIENT1: [00:13:12] After that we’ll still have before‑ and after‑school for both of them, but much less than now.  

ADVISOR: [00:13:18] So the next year is heavy on childcare, then it drops to a smaller amount. When that thousand a month frees up, have you thought about where you’d want it to go?

CLIENT1: [00:13:26] I’ve thought about bumping up my 401(k) when childcare eases. Right now I’m at ten percent; I’d like to get closer to, like, twelve or fifteen.  

CLIENT2: [00:13:35] I was thinking finally having money left to breathe. Maybe some towards travel, some towards savings. Not super specific.  

ADVISOR: [00:13:42] Totally fair. We’ll decide later whether that freed‑up cash goes more toward retirement or more toward lifestyle.  

Outside housing and childcare, what do you usually spend on groceries, eating out, day‑to‑day?

CLIENT2: [00:13:53] Groceries are… oh, it’s embarrassing.  

CLIENT1: [00:13:56] We’re terrible.  

CLIENT2: [00:13:58] Probably seven to eight hundred a month on food. That includes some takeout because by Friday I can’t be bothered to cook.  

CLIENT1: [00:14:05] And we eat out maybe twice a month, like a proper restaurant. That’s another one‑fifty to two hundred each time for the four of us.  

ADVISOR: [00:14:14] So food and going out are a decent chunk. If you imagine yourselves retired in your fifties, do you think that pattern changes?

CLIENT1: [00:14:20] Groceries might be similar, maybe a bit lower once the kids are gone.  

CLIENT2: [00:14:24] But we’d want to go out more. Like actually enjoy a long lunch on a Tuesday.  

ADVISOR: [00:14:28] Makes sense—less feeding growing kids, more lifestyle. How about travel now? What do you usually spend in a year?

CLIENT2: [00:14:35] We try to do one bigger trip and then a couple of small ones. Last year we did Portugal for ten days. That was, I want to say, around four grand all‑in.  

CLIENT1: [00:14:43] And we go to my parents’ place in North Carolina once or twice. That’s cheaper because we don’t pay for accommodation, but flights for four of us add up—maybe another two grand if we go twice.  

CLIENT2: [00:14:53] So maybe six to seven thousand a year on travel, some years less.  

ADVISOR: [00:14:58] Is travel something you’d willingly cut back on to hit early retirement, or one of the things you’d like to protect?

CLIENT2: [00:15:04] I’d like to protect it. That’s kind of the point of retiring early.  

CLIENT1: [00:15:08] We could dial it down while the kids are expensive, but long term I’d like a decent travel budget.  

ADVISOR: [00:15:14] Okay. Any other regular outgoings that feel big? Car loans, student loans, gym, kids’ activities?

CLIENT1: [00:15:21] We’ve got one car loan—Patricia’s Subaru. Payment is about three‑twenty a month. That ends in, I think, two years?  

CLIENT2: [00:15:28] Yeah, something like that. I owe around twelve thousand on it. My car’s the “nice” one.  

CLIENT1: [00:15:33] My Honda’s paid off, worth maybe ten grand.  

CLIENT2: [00:15:36] I’ve got a gym membership, forty‑nine a month, and Pilates classes now and then, maybe another fifty if I actually go.  

CLIENT1: [00:15:43] Kids’ stuff too—soccer for Ethan, dance for Mia. That’s probably ninety a month between them.  

ADVISOR: [00:15:49] Anything on credit cards carrying a balance month to month?

CLIENT1: [00:15:52] No, we pay them off. We did a zero‑percent deal when we redid the kitchen but that’s gone now.  

ADVISOR: [00:15:58] Great. So main debts are the mortgage and the Subaru loan.  

Let’s layer your retirement assets on top of that picture. William, you mentioned the 401(k) at Redwood. Roughly how much is in there now?

CLIENT1: [00:16:09] Last time I checked it was around two‑twenty, two‑thirty.  

ADVISOR: [00:16:13] All pre‑tax?

CLIENT1: [00:16:15] Yeah, all traditional.  

ADVISOR: [00:16:17] Do you know how it’s invested—target‑date fund, mix of funds?

CLIENT1: [00:16:20] It’s in a target‑date fund, the 2045 one they set up when I joined. I never changed it.  

ADVISOR: [00:16:26] Okay. Any old 401(k)s from previous jobs?

CLIENT1: [00:16:29] Yeah. I rolled one over to an IRA at Vanguard. That’s maybe ninety‑ish thousand now. We moved it a few years ago.  

CLIENT2: [00:16:37] It was thirty or forty at first and it’s grown. Markets have been up.  

ADVISOR: [00:16:42] That Vanguard IRA—do you remember the fund?

CLIENT1: [00:16:45] I’m in their LifeStrategy Growth portfolio. I clicked “growth” and left it alone.  

ADVISOR: [00:16:50] That’s roughly two‑thirds stocks, one‑third bonds, with some international. Are you comfortable with the ups and downs you’ve seen there?

CLIENT1: [00:16:57] I didn’t love 2022, but I didn’t lose sleep. For long‑term stuff I’m okay with a bit of swing.  

ADVISOR: [00:17:03] Perfect. Any other retirement‑type accounts for you?

CLIENT1: [00:17:06] I’ve got an HSA through work, about eight thousand in it, most of it invested in index funds. And an old Roth IRA at Vanguard from years ago, like five grand in it.  

ADVISOR: [00:17:16] Good. Patricia, what do you have on your side?

CLIENT2: [00:17:19] I’m in the state teacher retirement system, so it’s more of a pension than a 401(k). Then there’s a 403(b) option through the district. I started that a couple years ago; there’s maybe twenty‑ish thousand in there.  

ADVISOR: [00:17:31] The pension itself—do they show a “contributions” or “cash value” number on your statement?

CLIENT2: [00:17:36] I saw something like fifty‑something thousand on the last statement, but I don’t know if that’s what I can actually take out.  

ADVISOR: [00:17:42] That’s usually your contributions plus interest. More importantly, it will translate into a monthly income later. Do you remember any projection, like “if you retire at 65 you get X per month”?

CLIENT2: [00:17:52] It had a table. I think at 65 it was around, I don’t know, maybe fifteen hundred or something? I’d have to dig it out.  

ADVISOR: [00:18:00] That’s fine for now. The 403(b)—who’s the provider?

CLIENT2: [00:18:04] Principal. It’s just in one of their target‑date funds. I think 2055. I put in, um, ten percent from my paycheck, the district matches four.  

ADVISOR: [00:18:14] Okay. Any IRAs in your own name?

CLIENT2: [00:18:17] Not yet. I was going to open a Roth with some of the inheritance this year; I just haven’t done the paperwork.  

ADVISOR: [00:18:23] Got it. So likely we’ll use some inheritance each year to max Roth IRAs for both of you. That, plus a regular brokerage account, gives you flexibility in your fifties before everything like Social Security and full pension kicks in.  

CLIENT1: [00:18:34] Yeah, we definitely want that flexibility. We don’t want everything locked up until fifty‑nine and a half.  

ADVISOR: [00:18:39] Exactly.  

William, you also mentioned an old pension from a past employer?

CLIENT1: [00:18:43] Yeah. I used to work for Lakeshore Utilities, the power company. There’s a small defined‑benefit pension there.  

ADVISOR: [00:18:50] Do you recall what the statement said it would pay?

CLIENT1: [00:18:53] I got a statement maybe a year ago. If I start at sixty‑five it was around four to five hundred a month. If I start at sixty, it drops to like three hundred‑something.  

ADVISOR: [00:19:03] Earliest start age on that was sixty?

CLIENT1: [00:19:06] Yeah, that’s what it said.  

ADVISOR: [00:19:08] Okay. And have either of you looked at your Social Security statements recently?

CLIENT1: [00:19:12] I logged in maybe six months ago. At full retirement, sixty‑seven, mine was around twenty‑four hundred a month. At sixty‑two it was like sixteen hundred.  

CLIENT2: [00:19:22] Mine’s lower. I took a few years off with the kids and I work part‑time. I think it showed about fifteen or sixteen hundred at sixty‑seven.  

ADVISOR: [00:19:30] Great. We’ll treat those as ballparks and plug them into the projections.  

Let’s swing back to non‑retirement investments for a moment. Other than the cash in Ally and the credit union, do you have any regular taxable brokerage accounts yet?

CLIENT2: [00:19:42] No proper one yet. That’s what we were thinking for part of the inheritance, so we’re not just in cash.  

CLIENT1: [00:19:47] I’ve got a little Robinhood account, maybe ten, twelve thousand, mostly random tech stocks. More “fun money” than a plan.  

CLIENT2: [00:19:54] I have a tiny Acorns thing, like a couple thousand.  

ADVISOR: [00:19:59] Okay, small “side” accounts. Any inherited investment accounts, or was it all cash plus the cabin?

CLIENT1: [00:20:05] Mostly cash plus the cabin. My mom had some investments but they were mostly liquidated as part of the estate, then split.  

ADVISOR: [00:20:11] Got it. So the big opportunity is deciding how much of that Ally balance we keep in cash vs how much we move into long‑term investments.  

Before we talk about paying off the mortgage vs investing, I want to touch on how you feel about risk with this inheritance. If you invested, say, three hundred thousand and in a bad year it dropped fifteen percent—that’s forty‑five thousand on paper—what’s your gut reaction?

CLIENT1: [00:20:32] I wouldn’t love it. But I also know that’s how markets work. If there’s a clear plan and we know we’re still on track long term, I think we could live with some swings. I don’t want to be super aggressive though.  

CLIENT2: [00:20:44] I’d say we’re middle‑of‑the‑road. When COVID hit, my little IRA lost money and I panicked and stopped looking at it. So I don’t want that level of stress. But I also know if we keep it all in cash we’ll never retire early.  

ADVISOR: [00:20:56] That’s really helpful. After this call I’ll text you both a short risk questionnaire. It’ll put some numbers around “middle‑of‑the‑road”. For now I’ll assume a moderate approach—more growth than bonds, but not on the extreme end. And we can adjust once you’ve seen some options.  

CLIENT1: [00:21:09] And if we start and it feels too risky, we can dial it back, right?

ADVISOR: [00:21:13] Absolutely. It’s not fixed forever. We can step the risk up or down over time.  

Let’s talk about the mortgage in that context, because it’s emotionally a big decision. When you think of the inheritance, what’s your first instinct—pay the house off, pay it down, or leave it and invest?

CLIENT1: [00:21:28] My gut was “just clear the mortgage and be done.” But then I read stuff saying if your rate is low, you’re better off investing. Our rate’s like two‑point‑something from the refi.  

CLIENT2: [00:21:38] I like the idea of not having a mortgage, emotionally. But I also want to make sure we can retire, you know, around fifty‑five for me, maybe a bit earlier for Will if his joints don’t hold up. So if keeping some mortgage and putting more into investments works out better, I’m open to that.  

ADVISOR: [00:21:51] William, for you, if we left some or all of the mortgage in place but built up more in pensions and investments instead, would that feel okay? Or is the idea of being mortgage‑free before retirement really important?

CLIENT1: [00:22:00] I’d like it gone before we stop work. I don’t want to be sixty‑five and still paying a bank every month. But I don’t know that I need it gone tomorrow. Maybe we use part of the inheritance to knock it down, shorten the term?  

ADVISOR: [00:22:11] That’s the sort of trade‑off we’ll model. One version where you use, say, a third of the inheritance to reduce or knock out the mortgage, and another where you leave the mortgage and invest more. Then you can see what each does to your retirement age and income.  

CLIENT2: [00:22:23] I like seeing it both ways. I change my mind every week.  

ADVISOR: [00:22:27] Totally normal.  

On protection and planning—because you’ve just been through sorting out a parent’s estate—do you have wills in place at the moment?

CLIENT1: [00:22:35] Kind of. We did one of those online templates about five years ago, before our son was born and before this money. It basically just says everything goes to the other person.  

CLIENT2: [00:22:45] We updated it once after our son came to name my sister as guardian. But it doesn’t mention the inheritance or anything about trusts.  

ADVISOR: [00:22:52] Any powers of attorney or healthcare directives?

CLIENT1: [00:22:55] No, just the basic wills.  

ADVISOR: [00:22:58] Have you thought about whether you’d want any of that inheritance ring‑fenced for the kids—college or otherwise—versus just everything going to the survivor and then the kids?

CLIENT2: [00:23:06] We’ve talked about setting some aside for college and the rest being for our retirement. But we haven’t gone as far as, like, a trust document.  

CLIENT1: [00:23:13] After dealing with probate for my mom I’m kind of thinking we should. We just don’t know where to start.  

ADVISOR: [00:23:19] That makes sense. I’ll suggest a couple of estate attorneys who can modernize the wills and, if it suits you, set up a simple revocable trust so everything—including the inheritance—flows smoothly if something happens to either of you.  

CLIENT2: [00:23:30] That would be good. I don’t want our kids to go through what we did with his mom’s estate.  

ADVISOR: [00:23:35] Understood.  

I want to circle back to your monthly savings ability, because that’s the other lever besides the inheritance. Right now, between the 401(k), the 403(b), and anything else, roughly how much are you saving each month?

CLIENT1: [00:23:47] Ten percent of my salary into the 401(k) is, what, around eight hundred a month?  

CLIENT2: [00:23:52] Yeah, roughly.  

CLIENT1: [00:23:54] Then about four hundred a month goes into the Vanguard IRA automatically.  

CLIENT2: [00:23:58] My 403(b) is ten percent, so that’s maybe two‑something a paycheck. I don’t have anything outside that yet, besides the little Acorns.  

ADVISOR: [00:24:07] So between you, you’re already putting maybe $1,500–$1,700 a month into retirement accounts. Once daycare and the car loan drop off, how much extra do you feel you could invest on top of that, in a regular brokerage or Roths?

CLIENT2: [00:24:19] Once daycare’s gone, we think we could do maybe fifteen hundred to two thousand a month. Not tomorrow, but within a year or so.  

CLIENT1: [00:24:26] Yeah, somewhere in that ballpark. We’d want to keep some flexibility for house stuff.  

ADVISOR: [00:24:32] And in terms of keeping money very safe, how big a cash buffer feels right? Six months of expenses, a year?

CLIENT1: [00:24:38] I’d say at least six months. Maybe closer to a year because of the kids. Our monthly spend is what, Pat, six, seven grand?

CLIENT2: [00:24:45] Yeah, around that including everything. I’d feel better with, like, seventy, eighty thousand in cash. Then we can actually invest the rest instead of letting it just sit.  

ADVISOR: [00:24:54] That lines up with what a lot of families your age do. So we’re mentally earmarking roughly eighty thousand as “do not invest,” and the remainder of the inheritance plus future savings are fair game for the plan.  

CLIENT1: [00:25:05] That sounds right.  

ADVISOR: [00:25:08] Let me ask about insurance really briefly. Do either of you currently have life insurance through work or individually?

CLIENT1: [00:25:14] I’ve got whatever the default is through Redwood—two times salary, I think. No private policy.  

CLIENT2: [00:25:19] I’ve got one times salary through the district. No separate policy either.  

ADVISOR: [00:25:24] Okay, we’ll look at whether you still need additional cover now that you’ve got the inheritance as a backstop, especially until the kids are grown and the mortgage is lower.  

CLIENT2: [00:25:31] Yeah, we’ve never really looked at it properly.  

ADVISOR: [00:25:35] One other question from a planning angle: Trish, you mentioned maybe cutting back to three days a week—well, you’re already at three—is there any thought of going down further, or William, you reducing hours, if the plan says you can?

CLIENT2: [00:25:46] I sometimes daydream about two days a week, but I don’t want to kill our retirement.  

CLIENT1: [00:25:51] For me it’s more not wanting to do fifty‑hour weeks forever. If we can use the inheritance smartly, I’d like the option to scale back in my fifties even if I don’t fully retire right away.  

ADVISOR: [00:25:59] Totally reasonable. We can model “soft landing” scenarios too—like William dropping to four days at fifty‑five, you to two or three days, and see how that impacts things.  

CLIENT2: [00:26:07] That would be amazing if it’s possible.  

ADVISOR: [00:26:11] Coming back to investments for a second: over the next few years, the plan will probably involve three main buckets—your workplace plans (401(k), 403(b)), Roth IRAs for each of you, and a joint taxable brokerage funded from the inheritance and surplus cashflow. How do you feel about consolidating some of the smaller “fun” accounts into that structure?

CLIENT1: [00:26:28] I’d actually like that. It’s annoying having logins all over the place.  

CLIENT2: [00:26:32] Yeah, I don’t care about my Acorns, really.  

ADVISOR: [00:26:35] Okay. We can keep the Robinhood as your “play money” if you want, but we’ll base the serious plan on the larger accounts.  

CLIENT1: [00:26:40] That works.  

ADVISOR: [00:26:43] How are you both feeling about everything we’ve covered so far? Overwhelmed, or does this feel manageable?

CLIENT2: [00:26:48] It’s a lot, but in a good way. It’s the first time we’ve actually said all the numbers out loud.  

CLIENT1: [00:26:53] Yeah, same. We’ve kind of been guessing up to now.  

ADVISOR: [00:26:57] That’s completely normal.  

Two last areas I want to touch briefly today: college for the kids and how you view that in relation to retirement, and then any big upcoming expenses—remodels, new cars—that might use some inheritance money.  

On college, are you hoping to fully fund four‑year degrees for both, help a bit, or somewhere in between?

CLIENT2: [00:27:13] Somewhere in between. I’d like to help so they’re not drowning in loans, but I don’t feel like we have to pay one hundred percent of everything.  

CLIENT1: [00:27:20] Yeah, agreed. We haven’t started 529s yet but we’ve talked about it.  

ADVISOR: [00:27:24] Okay, we’ll look at whether putting, say, a small slice of the inheritance into 529s makes sense versus keeping everything focused on your retirement first.  

And any big one‑off things you’re thinking of using the inheritance for? Major renovations, new cars, that sort of thing?

CLIENT1: [00:27:36] We’d like to eventually redo the bathrooms and maybe finish the basement, but nothing urgent this year.  

CLIENT2: [00:27:41] Maybe set aside a little for that, but not blow, like, a hundred grand on a kitchen.  

ADVISOR: [00:27:46] Good. That makes it easier to keep the inheritance working for your long‑term goals.  

Before we wrap, is there anything we haven’t talked about that’s worrying you? Any “what if” questions about retiring in your fifties?

CLIENT2: [00:27:57] I guess the big thing for me is, if we stop working in, say, our late fifties, do we just live off the investments until Social Security and my pension kick in? That gap scares me a bit.  

ADVISOR: [00:28:07] That’s exactly what we’ll map out. Roughly, yes—you’d use a combination of the taxable brokerage, Roth IRAs, and, later, possibly the 401(k)/403(b) once you’re old enough. The inheritance is effectively giving you that bridge money, as long as it’s invested sensibly.  

CLIENT1: [00:28:19] So the idea is: build enough in the “bridge” bucket plus the pensions so we can coast into Social Security rather than white‑knuckling it.  

ADVISOR: [00:28:25] Exactly.  

CLIENT2: [00:28:28] Okay, that makes me feel better.  

ADVISOR: [00:28:32] I’ll text you the risk questionnaires after we hang up, and a secure link so you can upload a few things: latest statements for the 401(k), Vanguard IRA, HSA, your 403(b) and pension, plus a screenshot or statement for the Ally account and the mortgage. Once I’ve crunched those numbers, we’ll get together again and start putting actual dollar amounts next to “pay down mortgage,” “invest for early retirement,” and “keep in cash.”  

CLIENT1: [00:28:53] Sounds good. I can pull most of that tonight.  

CLIENT2: [00:28:56] Yeah, I’ll dig out my pension stuff from the big scary drawer.  

ADVISOR: [00:29:00] Perfect. We’ll take it from there.
